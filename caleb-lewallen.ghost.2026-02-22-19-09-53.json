                        "plaintext": "About a year ago I found out I was going to be taking on a brand new role inside of my company. I would be leading a department of three (me, myself, and I) on a quest to help our still young company to “grow up” a bit in the way that we approached building our product. This department, called Product Strategy, would be responsible for developing the frameworks that we used to decide what our product would become, and to evangelize that vision within our company.\n\nThe very first challenge we had to tackle was making sure we were all on the same page with where this company was going. We were going through a pretty rapid expansion, experiencing above average growth in customer base and headcount. This increase in headcount included growth in our leadership team. As our leaders grew in their respective roles, so did the number of opinions on what it is we needed to do next.\n\nThis isn’t a bad thing — these opinions all highlighted areas of improvement that needed to be made in our company and our product. But before we were going to resolve any of these issues and move forward as a more mature company, we would need to make sure we were all speaking the same language.\n\nThe first question — is this a Product or a Platform?\n\n\nBuilding a Product\n\nSo first off, let’s talk about Products. These are conceptually simpler than platforms, and therefore simpler to develop. You already know intuitively what a product is — it’s something that was created to serve a limited purpose, a specific solution to a specific problem.\n\nHoliday API is a perfect example of this. This is a one-off solution to a problem for anyone who’s had to contend with calendars before. This product provides you with a list of public holidays for just about any country in the world. It solves the problem beautifully too, giving you not only the actual holiday, but the observed date as well. It makes working with any date-based functionality that much easier.\n\nProducts are often some of the most pleasant types of software to work with. Because the scope is so small, the developers can focus on making the interaction with that product perfect. However, because the scope of the solution is so limited, it also makes the impact that product can have limited as well.\n\nAs great and amazing as Holiday API is, it’s reach can only extend to users who are creating software that require some sort of date based functionality that needs to know when public holidays are occurring, and the end user needs to know how to code. Because I fit that criteria exactly, my experience with the product has been amazing. But the second I lose one of those, the product is worthless to me.\n\nThat’s okay though, not every product is going to be useful to every person. It just means that my reach as a business is limited.\n\n\nBuilding a Platform\n\nA platform is software that connects products. These are more complex to work with, but the number of problems they can solve becomes broader. This is an important concept, because we shift away from solutions being product-led and towards solutions being user-led. Because of this, we’re not limited to a strictly defined user with a strictly defined problem.\n\nZapier is a great platform example. It’s a platform with a sole purpose of connecting OTHER products together. Their webpage shows an example of this. When your sales team gets a lead on Facebook, post a notification in Slack, and finally add that person to our CRM. Zapier’s platform isn’t part of any of those products, but it can connect all of them together.\n\nPlatforms can be a little more challenging to work with, because of the user led solutions model. This puts some of the problem solving back on the user. However, if the platform connects functionality appropriately, then it means the user can solve many more problems that with a product.\n\nI’ve used Zapier myself, and while getting all of the API’s to work flawlessly can sometimes be a little bit of a challenge, it’s always been due to user error (i.e. yours truly) and not the platform itself. It just took a little more effort on my end. In exchange for this extra effort, I get to automate a near infinite number of workflows and solve an infinite number of problems. The platform can be useful to nearly anyone.\n\nKeep in mind that while this is in theory more useful to more people, it is harder to pull off.\n\n\nWhich to do?\n\nAs with most questions, it’s not that straightforward. You can imagine the Product-Platform Continuum as existing on a spectrum, like this:\n\nWe have pure products on one side, with pure platforms on the other. In reality, most software applications fit somewhere in the middle.\n\nThink of a product ecosystem. Apple products all work together seamlessly in order to get you to buy other Apple products. If you have an iPhone, you can iMessage on your Mac or iPad as well, making you more likely to buy those products over a competitor’s. Google’s ecosystem is software based instead of hardware, but it’s intent is to keep getting you back to Google search and clicking on those sweet, sweet ads. The most popular phone OS in the world by a wide margin is Android, which defaults you to Google as it’s search engine. Chrome, the world’s most popular browser by far, also uses Google as it’s default search engine. This ecosystem is meant for you to keep using Google search and clicking on Google ads.\n\nEach one of those products above isn’t a pure product or a pure platform, it’s something in between. They all exist as independent products, but they’re also all interconnected into an extended platform.\n\nIf you run cloud-based software, it’s almost inevitable that you will find that you have created some sort of limited platform, even if it’s not your intent. It’s difficult to create a standalone product that creates a significant amount of value all on its own.\n\n\nThe Product Evolution\n\nGenerally speaking, almost no platforms start life as a platform (they do, but those are rare). Instead, products tend to evolve into platforms, settling somewhere in between each pure state.\n\nOur application is the same. We started life as a well-defined singular product, that over time has morphed into platform of products. Some of the products we’ve created ourselves, and others are 3rd party products.\n\nI want to stress that you shouldn’t equate Product = Bad and Platform = Good. They each have their benefits. Sometimes you just need a holiday api — something that solves a very specific need really, really well. Other times you just need a platform to connect all of your other products together. Most applications just naturally end up being somewhere in between.\n\nP.S. Aristotle\n\nThe Ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, is often credited with saying, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts”. As it turns out with a lot of clever sayings from the past, this isn’t entirely true. The actual quote¹ reads,\n\n“In the case of all things which have several parts and in which the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the parts, there is a cause; for even in bodies contact is the cause of unity in some cases, and in others viscosity or some other such quality.”\n\nIn light of what we’ve discussed above, I like this version better. When you’re building your software application, having a platform isn’t better than having a product. After all, since platform is something besides the collection of products, not necessarily better than them.\n\n[1] Aristotle’s Metaphysics, Book VIII, 1045a.8–10, 1908 translation by W. D.

                        "plaintext": "I think one of the most difficult aspects of building debt management software is defining exactly what that means. It’s also one of the more interesting thought exercises to walk through. It’s something every real estate firm does, but everyone has their own practices and methods for it. In some firms, it’s a joint exercise between executives, in others it’s up to the asset managers, and in others still there are dedicated finance teams to stay on top of debt portfolios.\n\nTo accomplish their task, processes are usually set up to solve specific problems as they come up. Organize files in a drive system so we can read docs. Go run a prepay calc when we’re thinking about a disposition. Create a spreadsheet to keep track of Lender Compliance requirements. All one-off solutions to fix specific problems.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with this approach, I imagine most best practices started life as people creating ad hoc processes to solve problems as they came up. Eventually, processes are refined and connected to create best practices. These practices have existed for Asset Management for a long time. You would be hard pressed to find an asset manager that couldn’t easily fill into a similar role at a new firm.

These capabilities have been designed in such a way that you do not have to do all 3 simultaneously, but rather build on one another and can be implemented over time.\n\n\nDecision Making Capability\n\nThe foundational capability for any management practice is to enable decision making. The same is true for both asset management and debt management. These practices exist so that you can make timely, informed decisions.\n\nTo master this capability, you want to be able to fulfil the following elements.\n\n * Locate loan information quickly — This will usually involve creating quality loan abstracts and linking the data back to the original reference in the loan docs.\n * Create reference calculations that can be updated easily — Think about the different data points you need to reference frequently, or those where timeliness is an advantage.

These sophisticated debt structures often mean a greater administration burden. Don’t worry though, because we anticipated this and began laying the groundwork for this well ahead of time.\n\nJust like last time, there are elements to this capability that we need to be able to master.\n\n * Lender Compliance — Am I the only one who thinks it’s funny/odd that the lender relies on the borrower’s math to prove they’re in compliance?

The first part of the series can be found here.\n\nIf you’ve ever worked in a software company, especially one that gets anywhere close to the FinTech space, you’ll have at least heard the tales of someone who has been through a SOC II audit. For those that aren’t familiar, SOC II is basically a set of standards that, once passed, indicate to the outside world that you meet some minimum security requirements for storing and transmitting your customer’s data. If you feel like boring yourself to tears, you can read more about SOC II here.\n\nOnce of the defining characteristics of becoming SOC II compliant are setting a series of Policies and Controls. The policy is the requirement, the control is how you enforce the requirement. They’re effective tools for risk management, and a principle we can use in order to build our own Debt Management Policies.\n\nWe’ve spent the last several posts in this series talking about Policies, including portfolio-level debt standards and loan requirements checklists. In this post, we’ll take a brief look at how to set Controls so you don’t put in a bunch of work for nothing.\n\n\nSetting Controls\n\nIn order to set effective controls, they need to be specific and contain the actions someone needs to take if an exception to the policy needs to be made. Controls don’t need to be long and detailed, they just need to give your colleagues enough information to know where to go next.\n\n\nPolicy Controls\n\nWe’ll define the different characteristics this control needs to be effective. The primary outcomes we want to achieve from these controls are accountability and transparency. In other words, if something goes wrong 2 years from now, can you look back and see who made what decision and why?\n\n\n1. State the Requirement and Point to the Policy\n\nFirst things first, simply restate the fact there’s a requirement that’s expected to be followed. For example, call out that there is a Capitalization Rate requirement and a Portfolio DSC requirement. Let the reader know exactly where they can find the policy, which will contain the latest information on how the standard is to be followed.\n\n\n2. Outline How Compliance is Met, Along With Any Deliverables\n\nUsing Capitalization Rate as an example, outline how testing is to be performed to ensure that the proposed financing meets the portfolio requirements. Ideally, you should require some sort of compliance deliverable to evidence that the requirement was met. Something as simple as an updated spreadsheet showing those point-in-time values would suffice. If these first two steps are met, the controls are satisfied and you can move on. If these can’t be met, move on to the 3rd section.\n\n\n3. Provide Paths for Exceptions\n\nSomeone is going to ask for an exception to the rule. If we just bend the rules for this deal, we can make a lot of money — you know it’s coming. Sometimes, there is valid cause for making exceptions to that rule, which all comes back to your business plans and risk tolerance. If an exception needs to be made, you need to have spelled out in the control:\n\n * How a request for an exception can be initiated\n * Who is authorized to approve the exception, and how that authorization is recorded\n * The types of deliverables required to evidence the reasoning for the exception (i.e. a document outlining the rationale behind the request, as well as any evidence or analysis to support the rationale).\n * Where all of the evidence, deliverables, and approval documentation needs to be stored, and for how long.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe point of all of this isn’t to be a pain, it’s to provide the accountability and transparency we described above. If we make an exception and it turns out to be a bad decision, we want to point back to why that decision was made, whether there was any way to have foreseen the problem, and how to prevent the same mistake in the future.\n\nThis is Part 5 of the Debt Management Policy series.\n\nNext: Challenges You Will Face Implementing Debt Management Policies\n\nThe Debt Management Policy is a short series of articles that provide the resources and materials for building and establishing Debt Management Policies for your own CRE firm.\n\n 1.

The first part of the series can be found here.\n\nAnytime a company does something new and exciting, there’s usually two types of people that speak into the implementation. There are the Visionaries — those that look for the new things that can transform their business vertical in revolutionary ways. There are also the Status Quo Incumbents — the people who don’t like change and are at most willing to implement evolutionary changes.

It’s going to be a challenge, but it’s not insurmountable.\n\n\nThe Biggest Challenge\n\nYou’re going to need sign-off on this if you want to implement this across your entire org. You’re going to need high quality data about past debt performance to make this case. Top management won’t base these types of decisions on data which it does not understand, nor data in which it does not have great confidence.

With rates on the rise and odds of a recession looming, you can suggest implementing policies to help prepare for the next loosening cycle.\n\n\nBetter Late Than Never\n\nRaise your hand if this sounds familiar. When times are good, there’s no need to change our debt management policies because the money is flowing and we can easily cover our debt service. Why would we change what we’re doing? When the tides shift and suddenly everything is blowing up around you, we don’t need to change anything because it’s already too late to do anything about it.\n\nI don’t have an answer for how to address this internally inside your own firm, but it’s better late than never to put good policies in place.

                        "plaintext": "This article is part of the Debt Policy Series. The first part of the series can be found here.\n\nSo far we’ve established broad risk management policies for our entire portfolio. The top level policies are designed to help us defend against broad market risk — true debt management type risks. Unfortunately, I’m not here to tell you that debt management risk is an island that you can completely ignore asset management factors in your policy making.\n\nWe have to establish a set of policies that tie our broad debt management risk to our low-level asset management risk. An example of this risk is ignoring your firm’s disposition habits when making debt decisions. What we need then is a checklist of requirements that highlights those cross-sections of debt and asset risk.\n\n\nBuilding a Checklist\n\nI’m not going to pretend that this is an exhaustive list of everything you should ever think about. I’m sure just about everyone reading this has a story about an unusual debt provision that came out of left field to bite them. However, I do hope this gives you a good starting point to build a more thorough list based around your own experiences.\n\nI tend to think primarily in terms of interest rate risk management — that being the bulk of my professional background. Much of my checklist is going to be centered around that idea.\n\n\nInterest Rate Risks\n\nAs a commercial borrower, you cannot escape this risk. I like to describe this as going in risk or going out risk — you have to pick one.\n\nGoing in risk is when we take on the risk of rates when we enter the loan. Think of this like using floating rate debt (rates could run up on you like they have this year) or purchasing an interest rate cap (I buy an expensive cap in Dec 2022 and a recession causes rates to collapse next year — money spent in vain). In both of these scenarios we take on the rate risk from the outset, but in exchange I don’t have to really consider the impact of prepaying the loan early since the penalties are usually minimal, if there’s a penalty at all.\n\nGoing out risk is when we push back the interest rate risk to when we exit the loan. Think about things like prepayment penalties on a fixed rate loan, or terminating a swap. In these scenarios we locked in a fixed rate of interest so I don’t have to think about or manage that risk today, but there’s a risk that it comes back to bite us the next time we sell or refi.\n\nTo manage these risks, we want to establish the following checklist items:\n\n * Loan Term. This is going to be influenced by your business plan, but take into account your previous habits. How often do you end up prepaying a loan with more than a year of the loan term remaining?\n * Interest Rate. Also business plan dependent. For shorter term projects I tend to lean floating rate, since the prepayment penalty terms tend to be more flexible. For anything past 5 years, hedging with options can become absurdly expensive, so fixing or swapping the rate tends to make sense. Also consider the effects of interest rate floors.\n * Hedging Requirements. This will outline whether hedging is required for floating rate loans, what types of hedging instruments are allowed, and what % of the loan must be hedged.\n * Prepayment Terms. What sorts of prepayment terms do I find reasonable. Recalling our going in or going out perspective on rate risk, if I take on floating rate debt (Going in risk), I want to counter that by avoiding anything beyond a nominal prepayment penalty (Going out risk). You may need to be flexible here depending on the type of loan you’re after.\n\n\nEconomic Terms\n\nAs much as I wish this could just be an interest rate discussion, we do have to focus on other terms that start having more interaction with the asset management side of the equations.\n\n * Loan Amount. In a checklist form that’s deal agnostic, this is probably more focused on the actual underwriting criteria than the final amount. Take the time here to describe the types of risk you’re willing to take on. For example, if you’re using floating rate debt, you may want to use a DSC constraint that’s more conservative than if you used fixed. You may have different LTV requirements depending on the loan term.\n * Amortization. Do you have any requirements around the loan amort? For example only considering loans with at least a 30 year amort, and 1 year of IO periods.\n * Seniority. Are there any instances where subordinated debt makes sense to use?\n\n\nLoan Governance\n\nThere’s cost associated with the covenants you have to comply with. Help provide some guidance on what terms you’re ok with and how you’re willing to comply. Examples include:\n\n * Events of Default. This will be based on personal experience. Have there ever been weird EOD’s that you refuse to agree to anymore? How should those EOD’s be cured?\n * Escrow Accounts. What kinds of accounts are you ok with and what are deal breakers?\n * Lender Compliance. How often is compliance reporting required? Is financial covenant testing required? How often? Do you have the capability to do it?\n\n\nOther Terms\n\nAnything else that’s important to you can go here. For example, your Principals may have particular things around the types of Guarantys they’re willing to provide.\n\n * Guarantors. What type of Guaranty are your principals willing to provide? How much are they willing to provide? If there are multiple guarantors, are there any limitations to the recourse they are individually responsible for?\n\nYou’ll probably end up with several checklists depending on how many asset types you work with and the types of deals you work on. The important thing to keep in mind is that all of these items are just guidelines. There are always exceptions to the rule, which we talk about in the next part of our series, which covers what to do when reality just doesn’t allow us to work within the bounds of our standards and policies.\n\nYou can access our Loan Standards Checklist as a starting point for building your own.\n\nThis is Part 4 of the Debt Management Policy series.\n\nNext: Setting and Enforcing Debt Management Policies\n\nThe Debt Management Policy is a short series of articles that provide the resources and materials for building and establishing Debt Management Policies for your own CRE firm.\n\n 1. Why Your Middle-Market Real Estate Firm Needs a Debt Management Policy\n 2. A Better Approach To Debt Management\n 3. Creating Portfolio Debt Standards\n 4. Debt Standard Checklists for Individual Loans\n 5. Setting and Enforcing Debt Management Policies\n 6.

                        "html": "<p><em>This article is part of the Debt Policy Series. The first part of the series can be found </em><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/why-your-middle-market-real-estate-fund-needs-a-debt-policy/\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>So far we’ve covered why we need to change the way we approach debt management and quickly outlined a plan for fixing these issues. This next post will discuss specifics on how to implement these policy standards. The first thing you have to be able to do is establish your portfolio risk metric levels for total capitalization and debt service. These will levels will depend on your risk tolerance and business plans.</p><h3 id=\"capitalization-rate\">Capitalization Rate</h3><p>This is simply the amount of debt you’re willing to take on for the value of your assets, essentially a portfolio level LTV. This level needs to be set based on your risk tolerance and business plans, but shouldn’t be determined based on how well the economy is doing or the what the Fed is doing, especially when times are good. Market conditions can change way faster than you can de-lever.</p><p>In this instance, I’m an advocate for prudence. I’ve known a company to set a portfolio-wide capitalization rate as low as 45%, which may be a bit extreme for many companies, so it depends entirely on your risk appetite.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> We want financing flexibility. We want dry powder when things take a down turn. I’ve seen a lot of borrowers with loans maturing this year, and those with maturities coming in the next several months, get stuck in a tight place. Lenders are still willing to lend, but at higher cap rates and lower LTVs.</p><h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3><p>Let’s put some numbers to this and narrow in on a single asset. We’re going to assume that in 2019 we bought a property with a $1,000,000 NOI at a 4% Cap Rate. We were able to secure a loan at 75% LTV.</p><p>Fast forward to 2022, and it’s time for a refi, since our old loan is maturing. For simplification, we’re going to assume the NOI is still $1,000,000. I have no problem getting quotes from lenders, they’re still willing to lend. Aside from an increase in borrowing costs, the biggest change is a drop in valuations and lower leverage being offered. The best loan you can find is a 65% LTV at a 5% Cap Rate.</p><p>So if we plug these values in we get.</p><p>Good Times Loan = ($1M NOI / 4% Cap Rate) * 75% LTV = <strong>$18.75M Loan</strong></p><p>Bad Times Refi = ($1M NOI / 5% Cap Rate) * 65% LTV = <strong>$13M Loan</strong></p><p>Even though nothing’s really changed about our property, I still have to come to the table with more than $5M just to refi this loan! That $13M loan is the equivalent of a <strong>52% LTV </strong>loan back in 2019.</p><p>If we were smarter about this, we would have modelled out these risk factors back in 2019 to prepare for this. We can simplify the work we did above to determine our maximum LTV. Instead of underwriting our property to the good times, we’ll underwrite what we believe to be a bad times scenario, like a 65% LTV at a 5% Cap Rate.</p><p>The math is then: (65% Bad Times LTV * 4% Good Times Cap Rate) / 5% Bad Times Cap Rate = <strong>52% Good Times LTV</strong>. If this had been my Capitalization Rate standard in 2019, I would have only borrowed to a maximum of 52%.</p><h3 id=\"creating-a-standard\">Creating a Standard</h3><p>The way to create a standard is now to simply expand this to your entire portfolio. Using this methodology, you can calculate the maximum portfolio capitalization rate, as well as the maximum LTV each individual asset can take on to meet the standard at both an individual and portfolio level.</p><p>I’ve created a spreadsheet that you can use to manage this on your own. You can grab a copy of it and use it as is, or as a basis for creating something of your own.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ln6fVFQm22CAtzC9o7B7S8sWF75Dzxaivyqq3PHdpC4/edit#gid=0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener\">Get the Google Sheet</a></p><h3 id=\"keeping-it-simple\">Keeping it simple</h3><p>Sometimes the barrier to implementing something new is the initial lift. It’s a lot of work to go figure out the exact cap rate of a property at purchase, or what the cap rate of a property is now. If you know what your average cap rate is, then you can use the math above to figure out what your maximum capitalization rate should be.</p><p>Remember, the point is to set a standard for the MAX average LTV across all of your properties. This is the type of situation where fuzzy math is completely ok. The point is prevent (or at least minimize) the risk of having to ask investors for additional capital in order to refi, this doesn’t necessarily have to be really precise.</p><h3 id=\"debt-service-coverage\">Debt Service Coverage</h3><p>The DSC is the amount of principal and interest your property support with its net operating income. Just like with the capitalization rate, this should be set based on your risk tolerance and business plans. We want to plan for the future — especially when money is cheap and easy to find. Rates have increased dramatically, the time to make sure we could cover it was a year ago, not today.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> This policy standard serves dual purposes — to make sure that you can continue servicing floating rate loans if interest rates rise, but also to ensure that you don’t get DSCR constrained if you have to refi in a volatile, high interest rate environment. Because of this, we’re going to be approaching the DSC problem a little differently than your lender will. They don’t care how you perform once the loan is paid off, so we can’t use a credit facility example here. We have to refi this at some point!</p><h3 id=\"example-1\">Example</h3><p>We’re going to start with a single asset again to illustrate how this works. For our portfolio level work, we’re going to ignore what the actual loan definitions for debt service are — our goal is maintaining solvency, we’ll worry maintaining financial covenant requirements at the asset level.</p><p>In our example, we’re going to start with our earlier example — in 2019 I bought a property with a $1,000,000 NOI. The loan I got was sized at 4.5% over 30 years at a 1.25x DSCR, or roughly <strong>$13.15M</strong>.</p><p>Fast forward to 2022, it’s time to refi. We went back to the same lender who agreed to underwrite at the same terms of 30 year amort at a 1.25x DSCR, but now rates are up and we’re borrowing at around 7% (<em>Side Note: I think there’s something comical about the fact that this reasonable scenario would have sound ludicrous to all of us just a year ago</em>). At this rate, our loan gets sized back down to just $10M.</p><p>Just like with the capitalization rate scenario, nothing about our property has really changed, but I’ve still got to come up with over $3M just to refi my property. If we went back in time and borrowed money assuming that underwriting rates could jump to 7%, our DSCR would have been:</p><p><strong>NOI </strong>= $1,000,000</p><p><strong>Monthly Debt Service</strong> = ~$10M debt @ 4.50% over 30yrs = $50,772.42</p><p><strong>Annual Debt Service</strong> = $50,772.42 * 12 = $609,269.09</p><p><strong>DSCR</strong> = $1,000,000 / $609,269.09 = <strong>1.64x</strong></p><p>Had we had a crystal ball, we would have known to borrow at a max of a 1.64x DSCR at those rates.</p><h3 id=\"creating-a-standard-1\">Creating a Standard</h3><p>To apply this to our portfolio, we need to understand what our current borrowing rates are and what we think a worst case scenario is. Like always, there’s no magic to this, where you set that portfolio DSCR is dependent on what you envision as a reasonable “Bad Times” scenario.</p><p>Before we can apply this to our portfolio, we need to simplify the math, and preferably remove any absolute numbers from our math (no need to deal with $ values if we don’t have to). We can simplify the above work into the following (using Excel Formulas so you can plug these into your own).</p><blockquote><em>Amort Periods = 360</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>DS1 = PMT(Bad Times Rate / 12, Amort Periods, -1) x 12 x Min DSCR</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>DS2 = PMT(Good Times Rate / 12, Amort Periods, [-1 / DS1])</em></blockquote><p><strong>Good Times DSCR </strong>= 1 / DS2 * 12</p><p>What we’re solving for is the DSCR we should be sizing to given our assumptions about the bad times market environment we don’t want to be surprised by.</p><p>I’ve created a Google Sheet you can use as a starting point in designing your own portfolio standard.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sStdIwufp0jgyZPHMAMojv14aKLB0O0D3yGmKunYR3Q/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener\">Get the Google Sheet</a></p><h3 id=\"why-do-this\">Why Do This?</h3><p>If you have a crystal ball and can tell when big market swings are going to happen, then this isn’t for you.

The best loan you can find is a 65% LTV at a 5% Cap Rate.\n\nSo if we plug these values in we get.\n\nGood Times Loan = ($1M NOI / 4% Cap Rate) * 75% LTV = $18.75M Loan\n\nBad Times Refi = ($1M NOI / 5% Cap Rate) * 65% LTV = $13M Loan\n\nEven though nothing’s really changed about our property, I still have to come to the table with more than $5M just to refi this loan! That $13M loan is the equivalent of a 52% LTV loan back in 2019.\n\nIf we were smarter about this, we would have modelled out these risk factors back in 2019 to prepare for this. We can simplify the work we did above to determine our maximum LTV. Instead of underwriting our property to the good times, we’ll underwrite what we believe to be a bad times scenario, like a 65% LTV at a 5% Cap Rate.\n\nThe math is then: (65% Bad Times LTV * 4% Good Times Cap Rate) / 5% Bad Times Cap Rate = 52% Good Times LTV. If this had been my Capitalization Rate standard in 2019, I would have only borrowed to a maximum of 52%.\n\n\nCreating a Standard\n\nThe way to create a standard is now to simply expand this to your entire portfolio. Using this methodology, you can calculate the maximum portfolio capitalization rate, as well as the maximum LTV each individual asset can take on to meet the standard at both an individual and portfolio level.\n\nI’ve created a spreadsheet that you can use to manage this on your own. You can grab a copy of it and use it as is, or as a basis for creating something of your own.\n\nGet the Google Sheet\n\n\nKeeping it simple\n\nSometimes the barrier to implementing something new is the initial lift. It’s a lot of work to go figure out the exact cap rate of a property at purchase, or what the cap rate of a property is now. If you know what your average cap rate is, then you can use the math above to figure out what your maximum capitalization rate should be.\n\nRemember, the point is to set a standard for the MAX average LTV across all of your properties. This is the type of situation where fuzzy math is completely ok. The point is prevent (or at least minimize) the risk of having to ask investors for additional capital in order to refi, this doesn’t necessarily have to be really precise.\n\n\nDebt Service Coverage\n\nThe DSC is the amount of principal and interest your property support with its net operating income. Just like with the capitalization rate, this should be set based on your risk tolerance and business plans. We want to plan for the future — especially when money is cheap and easy to find. Rates have increased dramatically, the time to make sure we could cover it was a year ago, not today.\n\nWhy is this important? This policy standard serves dual purposes — to make sure that you can continue servicing floating rate loans if interest rates rise, but also to ensure that you don’t get DSCR constrained if you have to refi in a volatile, high interest rate environment. Because of this, we’re going to be approaching the DSC problem a little differently than your lender will. They don’t care how you perform once the loan is paid off, so we can’t use a credit facility example here. We have to refi this at some point!\n\n\nExample\n\nWe’re going to start with a single asset again to illustrate how this works. For our portfolio level work, we’re going to ignore what the actual loan definitions for debt service are — our goal is maintaining solvency, we’ll worry maintaining financial covenant requirements at the asset level.\n\nIn our example, we’re going to start with our earlier example — in 2019 I bought a property with a $1,000,000 NOI. The loan I got was sized at 4.5% over 30 years at a 1.25x DSCR, or roughly $13.15M.\n\nFast forward to 2022, it’s time to refi. We went back to the same lender who agreed to underwrite at the same terms of 30 year amort at a 1.25x DSCR, but now rates are up and we’re borrowing at around 7% (Side Note: I think there’s something comical about the fact that this reasonable scenario would have sound ludicrous to all of us just a year ago). At this rate, our loan gets sized back down to just $10M.\n\nJust like with the capitalization rate scenario, nothing about our property has really changed, but I’ve still got to come up with over $3M just to refi my property. If we went back in time and borrowed money assuming that underwriting rates could jump to 7%, our DSCR would have been:\n\nNOI = $1,000,000\n\nMonthly Debt Service = ~$10M debt @ 4.50% over 30yrs = $50,772.42\n\nAnnual Debt Service = $50,772.42 * 12 = $609,269.09\n\nDSCR = $1,000,000 / $609,269.09 = 1.64x\n\nHad we had a crystal ball, we would have known to borrow at a max of a 1.64x DSCR at those rates.\n\n\nCreating a Standard\n\nTo apply this to our portfolio, we need to understand what our current borrowing rates are and what we think a worst case scenario is. Like always, there’s no magic to this, where you set that portfolio DSCR is dependent on what you envision as a reasonable “Bad Times” scenario.\n\nBefore we can apply this to our portfolio, we need to simplify the math, and preferably remove any absolute numbers from our math (no need to deal with $ values if we don’t have to). We can simplify the above work into the following (using Excel Formulas so you can plug these into your own).\n\nAmort Periods = 360\n\nDS1 = PMT(Bad Times Rate / 12, Amort Periods, -1) x 12 x Min DSCR\n\nDS2 = PMT(Good Times Rate / 12, Amort Periods, [-1 / DS1])\n\nGood Times DSCR = 1 / DS2 * 12\n\nWhat we’re solving for is the DSCR we should be sizing to given our assumptions about the bad times market environment we don’t want to be surprised by.\n\nI’ve created a Google Sheet you can use as a starting point in designing your own portfolio standard.\n\nGet the Google Sheet\n\n\nWhy Do This?\n\nIf you have a crystal ball and can tell when big market swings are going to happen, then this isn’t for you. For the rest of us, the point of this kind of exercise and rigor around our debt portfolio management is precisely because we don’t have a crystal ball.\n\nAre you potentially leaving yourself with a lower ROE by purposefully limiting your debt exposure? Of course we are, but we’re also not finding ourselves completely underwater when we’re all surprised by the next black swan event.\n\nYou’ll notice that in our portfolio management practices we’ve purposefully left out absolute property values. This isn’t just to make the math simpler, it’s also to help remove the temptation of treating a debt management problem like it’s an asset management problem. If we only deal with debt variables, we can better manage our debt risk.\n\nThis is Part 3 of the Debt Management Policy series.\n\nNext: Debt Standard Checklists for Individual Loans\n\nThe Debt Management Policy is a short series of articles that provide the resources and materials for building and establishing Debt Management Policies for your own CRE firm.\n\n 1.

But I’ll give you the punchline first: now’s probably the best time to be a floating rate borrower.\n\n\nWhat Comes Up Must Come Down\n\nHistorically, the Federal Reserve has a really bad habit of overtightening and sending the economy into a recession. Four out of the last five tightening cycles ended in a recession, which required the Fed to sharply reduce rates in order to help the economy recover. This current tightening cycle looks more and more likely to end in a very predictable fashion, despite hopes for a soft landing. The Fed doesn’t really work in subtleties.\n\nWhile a lot of attention has been paid to the rapid increase in rates, it’s also important to consider how quickly rates tend to drop when it’s time for the Fed to cut. If you’re a borrower experiencing negative leverage, this is probably the concept you want to consider the most.\n\nConsider that the current LIBOR Forward Curve peaks in January 2023 (as of Oct 12, 2022), and really starts dropping off at the end of 2023. Meaning, markets are expecting the Fed to be forced to start cutting again by the end of next year.\n\nThis makes sense, and seems to be in line with historical rate cut patterns, where the Fed starts cutting on average a little less than 9 months after the last rate hike.\n\nOnce the cuts start happening, they typically happen quickly. In the last two loosening cycles, the Fed cut rates down to zero in less than 18 months.\n\nAdditionally, any cursory review of Fed Funds in the last 30 years will show that we tend to stay in the troughs for much longer than we stay at rate peaks. In other words, while borrowing costs are going up, and it’s tempting to try to lock in rates, keep in mind that rates tend to fall shortly after the Fed is done hiking and usually stay low for a while.\n\n\nInverted Yield Curve\n\nOkay, but what if this time is different? What if the Fed learned from past mistakes and isn’t completely shocking financial markets and the economy as a whole into a recession?\n\nWell, that’s a possibility, but consider that the yield curve is currently inverted, and has been since July.\n\nEven my mom knows that an inverted yield curve means recession is on the horizon. It’s literally never been wrong. Since recessions tend to be deflationary, and the Fed’s best weapon to fight a recession is to lower rates and get the money spigot flowing again, you can be almost certain that rates will start falling again within the next 12–24 months.\n\n\nDebt Management — How to Plan For Falling Rates\n\nThere’s a couple of things we can do to prepare for rates falling in the coming months. We need to not only consider plans for new financings, but for our existing loans as well. Falling interest rates are a friend to floating rate borrowers, but an enemy to fixed rate borrowers. Let’s talk about how to manage each.\n\nFixed Rate Loans\n\nIf you’re considering closing on a new fixed rate loan in the next several months, it’s probably best to wait. If history repeats itself, as it often does, we’re probably somewhere close to the peak before the next loosening cycle. Fixing a rate now is only going to work against you. Prepayments are going to kill you and make it next to impossible for you to refinance the loan. Your best options will be:\n\n * Get a floating rate loan instead. As the Fed cuts rates, your cost of debt will fall too. The prepayment flexibility will also make it much easier to refinance into a fixed rate loan later.\n * Ask your lender to waive prepayment penalties. If you want the assurance of a fixed rate loan, or you’re prohibited from using floating rates loans because of company policy or guidance, do everything you can to alleviate or remove prepayment penalty risk. Your penalty cost will go up as rates fall and make it impossible for you to refinance into a lower rate later.\n * Use short term loans. The goal is to be able to refinance into cheaper debt when financial conditions are more accommodative, use short term debt. Many short-term loans also include extension options, allowing you to push your maturity out another year if lending appetite isn’t what you need.\n * Use swaptions as a prepayment hedge. If you’re already in a fixed rate loan and think you may want to refinance or sell in the next 2 years, it might make sense to buy a fixed receiver swaption. This type of hedge will pay you in the event rates fall, and can help offset any increased prepayment costs.\n\nFloating Rate Loans\n\nFloating rate loans might be the best options in the near term. The Fed has already started signaling that we’re near the end of tightening and can expect to start levelling out early next year. Looking back to our historical references above, this means we can probably expect rates to start coming back down by the end of 2023. However, there’s still near-term risk we need to manage.\n\n * Use Interest Rate Caps. This will help protect you against any unexpected upside movement, while still allowing you to float down. Keep this short-term, and work with your derivatives broker to figure out optimal pricing.\n * Use short-term loans. Lenders are more conservative right now, so limit your cost of debt by using short-term floaters to keep loan spreads as low as possible.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAs we move forward into uncharted waters, the question on everyone’s mind is going to be whether the Fed can actually maintain a higher rate environment, or will they end up slashing rates again like in previous cycles? Make sure you’re prepared for what comes next so you’re not left holding the bag in the next loosening cycle.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

                        "html": "<p>As all CRE borrowers know, if you get a fixed rate loan, you’re more than likely going to be saddled with some sort of prepayment premium. There’s several common calculation methods, all going by different names (sometimes the wrong one), but they all follow the same basic concept.</p><p>The <strong>Make Whole Prepayment</strong> is straightforward in concept. When the lender agrees to make the loan, they expect to earn some rate of interest for a specific period of time. This rate of return is modeled into an ROE, and income is projected for the lender. If you want to prepay the loan early, the lender then has to redeploy those funds into an unknown interest rate and lending environment. This presents a series of risks to the lender:</p><ul><li>The lender has already earmarked those funds for deployment through the maturity of the loan. In order for you to prepay, they have to find an investment vehicle to redeploy those funds through the maturity of the paid off loan. This means the lender has to lend those funds out for a shorter amount of time, generally at a lower yield, an effect known as <strong>rolling down the yield curve</strong>.</li><li>New loans are typically priced as a spread over Treasurys, meaning the rate they’re able to lend at is dependent on rates at the time of the prepayment. If rates have fallen since the loan originally closed, the lender will get a lower rate of return, exposing them to <strong>interest rate risk</strong>.</li><li>Lenders are in the business of, well, lending. In order for the lender to redeploy those funds, there has to be 1) borrowers willing and qualified to take on debt and 2) sufficient appetite from the risk management department for new debt. This exposes lenders to various types of <strong>lending risk</strong>.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, the lender is trying to solve for the difference between the amount of interest income they thought they would receive and what you’ve paid so far, like so:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/max/800/1-iasv7cvodgcma5ndvk9c1g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"795\" height=\"604\"></figure><p></p><p>This leaves really only one investment vehicle for lenders with the necessary liquidity to facilitate any sort of rate of return: <strong>US Treasurys</strong></p><p>“Wait,” you may be thinking, “didn’t I lock this as a spread <em>over</em> Treasurys? Isn’t that going to leave the lender short?” If so, you would be correct. That means that you have to make up the difference.</p><p>So then the problem we have to solve is this — what lump sum of money, invested into a risk-free rate of interest, would yield the same dollar amount (FV) as the amount of interest still owed on the loan? There are three primary ways this is calculated.</p><ol><li>Yield Maintenance</li><li>Make Whole</li><li>Defeasance</li></ol><h3 id=\"financial-concept\">Financial Concept</h3><p>All fixed rate prepayments share the same financial concept, which is to replace or discount the future fixed rate loan payments with some risk-free rate of interest that the creditor could redeploy their funds to. For calculation purposes, USD based loans are typically discounted using US Treasury securities.</p><p>To calculate a back-of-the-hand estimation of a fixed rate prepayment, one would use this formula:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/max/800/1-dwdq809nep1ictruxrsgbw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"307\" height=\"33\"></figure><p></p><blockquote>L_avg <em>= Average loan balance through end of prepayment period</em></blockquote><blockquote>r_note<em> = Interest Rate on the Note</em></blockquote><blockquote>r_risk-free<em> = Yield on a US Treasury security equal to the term from the prepayment date through the end of the prepayment period</em></blockquote><blockquote>T_n — t_0<em> = Time in years from prepayment date to end of prepayment period</em></blockquote><p>For example, assume we have a <strong><em>10 year, non-amortizing loan of $25M priced at 5%</em></strong>. To make the math easy, let’s also assume a 30/360 daycount. Five years have passed since the loan close, and five years are remaining until maturity. The current five year treasury yield is 2.25%.</p><p>$25,000,000 x (5.00% — 2.25%) * 5_yrs = <strong>$3,437,500</strong></p><p>Keep in mind that this is just an estimate. This back-of-the-hand math has not PV’d the result and will generally be higher than your actual penalty.</p><h3 id=\"yield-maintenance\">Yield Maintenance</h3><p>First thing to note, this term is very often used a a catch-all term for prepayments in loan agreements. Just because your docs say “Yield Maintenance”, doesn’t mean your prepayment will be calculated as a yield maintenance.</p><p>The yield maintenance calculation method follows the concept above by calculating a hypothetical rate of interest that is the difference between the Note Rate and the Risk Free rate of interest. That is then discounted back to the prepayment date.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/max/800/1-kkskhpveisonqvobnblfyg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"465\" height=\"47\"></figure><p>The first couple of prepayment periods in the loan above would look like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/max/800/1-woh_9sqrhy86oyo5g5kqta.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"615\" height=\"294\"></figure><p>This process is repeated for the entirety of the remaining set of cashflows. The sum of the Yield Maintenance Interest column is taken, which represents the <strong>Prepayment Penalty</strong> of the loan.</p><p>In our example loan, the prepayment penalty is $3,248,315.86, which is pretty close to what we estimated in our back-of-the-hand method above.</p><blockquote>Most Yield Maintenance terms include a minimum penalty of 1%, which needs to be accounted for in your final result.</blockquote><h3 id=\"bonus-agency-style-yield-maintenance\">Bonus: Agency Style Yield Maintenance</h3><p>The big multifamily agency lenders, like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, have their own flavor of yield maintenance that they employ. This method assumes that all cashflows after the prepayment date are a hypothetical interest-only cashflow, discounted by an interpolated US Treasury Rate. This disadvantages the borrower if their loan amortizes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/max/800/1-lruadp_hmfmtld4ioa37xq.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"304\" height=\"66\"><figcaption><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Where OPB = Outstanding Principal Balance | r = Treasury Rate | z = time in years to end of prepayment period | R = Note&nbsp;Rate</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>This will also almost always have some minimum penalty, usually 1%.</p><h3 id=\"make-whole\">Make Whole</h3><p>The Make Whole method, often done under the moniker of “Yield Maintenance”, is probably the most common form of fixed rate prepayments in bank loans. While it will produce a penalty materially similar to that of Yield Maintenance, it is a distinct calculation with it’s own method.</p><p>Make whole calculations are essentially discounted cashflows. Mostly commonly, the language will require that you discount the remaining payments of the loan over through maturity, including the balloon payment. The discount rate is almost always Treasurys, often an interpolated rate from the daily H.15 publication from the Federal Reserve.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/max/800/1-hqydogotxhcz4r0cw9t-yg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"231\" height=\"73\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Where r = discount rate | T-t = time to today in&nbsp;years</span></figcaption></figure><p>The goal of this method is to find the <strong>total amount due to lender</strong> at prepayment. This, subtracted from the loan balance at the time of prepayment, is your penalty. A sampling of those cashflows would look something like this.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/max/800/1-myfolkdaxshmcpeftlcvbw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"626\" height=\"284\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The last period of the PV’d cashflows would include any principal balloon&nbsp;payment</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since this loan is interest only, the Make Whole penalty is identical to Yield Maintenance, at <strong>$3,248,315.86.</strong> The values will differ slightly if the loan amortizes.</p><p>Like our previous methods, some minimum penalty will usually apply.</p><h3 id=\"defeasance\">Defeasance</h3><p>Ah, Defeasance.

                        "plaintext": "As all CRE borrowers know, if you get a fixed rate loan, you’re more than likely going to be saddled with some sort of prepayment premium. There’s several common calculation methods, all going by different names (sometimes the wrong one), but they all follow the same basic concept.\n\nThe Make Whole Prepayment is straightforward in concept. When the lender agrees to make the loan, they expect to earn some rate of interest for a specific period of time. This rate of return is modeled into an ROE, and income is projected for the lender. If you want to prepay the loan early, the lender then has to redeploy those funds into an unknown interest rate and lending environment. This presents a series of risks to the lender:\n\n * The lender has already earmarked those funds for deployment through the maturity of the loan. In order for you to prepay, they have to find an investment vehicle to redeploy those funds through the maturity of the paid off loan. This means the lender has to lend those funds out for a shorter amount of time, generally at a lower yield, an effect known as rolling down the yield curve.\n * New loans are typically priced as a spread over Treasurys, meaning the rate they’re able to lend at is dependent on rates at the time of the prepayment. If rates have fallen since the loan originally closed, the lender will get a lower rate of return, exposing them to interest rate risk.\n * Lenders are in the business of, well, lending. In order for the lender to redeploy those funds, there has to be 1) borrowers willing and qualified to take on debt and 2) sufficient appetite from the risk management department for new debt. This exposes lenders to various types of lending risk.\n\nUltimately, the lender is trying to solve for the difference between the amount of interest income they thought they would receive and what you’ve paid so far, like so:\n\n\n\nThis leaves really only one investment vehicle for lenders with the necessary liquidity to facilitate any sort of rate of return: US Treasurys\n\n“Wait,” you may be thinking, “didn’t I lock this as a spread over Treasurys? Isn’t that going to leave the lender short?” If so, you would be correct. That means that you have to make up the difference.\n\nSo then the problem we have to solve is this — what lump sum of money, invested into a risk-free rate of interest, would yield the same dollar amount (FV) as the amount of interest still owed on the loan? There are three primary ways this is calculated.\n\n 1. Yield Maintenance\n 2. Make Whole\n 3. Defeasance\n\n\nFinancial Concept\n\nAll fixed rate prepayments share the same financial concept, which is to replace or discount the future fixed rate loan payments with some risk-free rate of interest that the creditor could redeploy their funds to. For calculation purposes, USD based loans are typically discounted using US Treasury securities.\n\nTo calculate a back-of-the-hand estimation of a fixed rate prepayment, one would use this formula:\n\n\n\nL_avg = Average loan balance through end of prepayment period\n\nr_note = Interest Rate on the Note\n\nr_risk-free = Yield on a US Treasury security equal to the term from the prepayment date through the end of the prepayment period\n\nT_n — t_0 = Time in years from prepayment date to end of prepayment period\n\nFor example, assume we have a 10 year, non-amortizing loan of $25M priced at 5%. To make the math easy, let’s also assume a 30/360 daycount. Five years have passed since the loan close, and five years are remaining until maturity. The current five year treasury yield is 2.25%.\n\n$25,000,000 x (5.00% — 2.25%) * 5_yrs = $3,437,500\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate. This back-of-the-hand math has not PV’d the result and will generally be higher than your actual penalty.\n\n\nYield Maintenance\n\nFirst thing to note, this term is very often used a a catch-all term for prepayments in loan agreements. Just because your docs say “Yield Maintenance”, doesn’t mean your prepayment will be calculated as a yield maintenance.\n\nThe yield maintenance calculation method follows the concept above by calculating a hypothetical rate of interest that is the difference between the Note Rate and the Risk Free rate of interest. That is then discounted back to the prepayment date.\n\nThe first couple of prepayment periods in the loan above would look like this:\n\nThis process is repeated for the entirety of the remaining set of cashflows. The sum of the Yield Maintenance Interest column is taken, which represents the Prepayment Penalty of the loan.\n\nIn our example loan, the prepayment penalty is $3,248,315.86, which is pretty close to what we estimated in our back-of-the-hand method above.\n\nMost Yield Maintenance terms include a minimum penalty of 1%, which needs to be accounted for in your final result.\n\n\nBonus: Agency Style Yield Maintenance\n\nThe big multifamily agency lenders, like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, have their own flavor of yield maintenance that they employ. This method assumes that all cashflows after the prepayment date are a hypothetical interest-only cashflow, discounted by an interpolated US Treasury Rate. This disadvantages the borrower if their loan amortizes.\n\nThis will also almost always have some minimum penalty, usually 1%.\n\n\nMake Whole\n\nThe Make Whole method, often done under the moniker of “Yield Maintenance”, is probably the most common form of fixed rate prepayments in bank loans. While it will produce a penalty materially similar to that of Yield Maintenance, it is a distinct calculation with it’s own method.\n\nMake whole calculations are essentially discounted cashflows. Mostly commonly, the language will require that you discount the remaining payments of the loan over through maturity, including the balloon payment. The discount rate is almost always Treasurys, often an interpolated rate from the daily H.15 publication from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe goal of this method is to find the total amount due to lender at prepayment. This, subtracted from the loan balance at the time of prepayment, is your penalty. A sampling of those cashflows would look something like this.\n\nSince this loan is interest only, the Make Whole penalty is identical to Yield Maintenance, at $3,248,315.86. The values will differ slightly if the loan amortizes.\n\nLike our previous methods, some minimum penalty will usually apply.\n\n\nDefeasance\n\nAh, Defeasance. A word known to cause dread in many an operator. If you haven’t been a part of a defeasance before, it’s just a process by which real estate cashflows are replaced with a series of maturing Treasury Bonds/Bills (i.e. a “substitution of collateral”). While the first several methods we covered try to answer the replacement question in a theoretical sense, the madman that created defeasance decided to actually carry it out.\n\nThis replacement is achieved by structuring a portfolio of securities, that by the virtue of their maturation, exactly replicates the cashflows that would have been delivered by the real estate. The goal of the securities broker and defeasance consultant is to find the most efficient portfolio (read: cheapest) portfolio of securities that can meet the cashflow requirements of the loan.\n\nThe goal of defeasance is to provide a means for a borrower to unencumber an assets from a securitized loan, while protecting the returns of the investors in the CMBS securitization. Your portfolio cost will be materially similar to that of a Make Whole, but will also incur $50K — $75K of additional transaction fees.\n\n\nDebt Management — How to Manage Prepayments\n\nSince this is a publication about debt management, let’s take a look at some characteristics of these prepayments and how to manage them to minimize risk.\n\n\nPrepayment Burndown\n\nDue to the calculation principles behind fixed rate prepayments, these loans typically have a characteristic of “burning down” over time. Each month a prepayment is delayed, the penalty will burndown by roughly the amount of the monthly loan payment, ceteris paribus.\n\nThe chart below shows the effect of the burndown over the 60 remaining months of our imaginary loan, assuming the risk-free rate of interest remains constant for the remaining term of the loan, calculated using the Yield Maintenance method. Note that the prepayment penalty decreases consistently until the minimum penalty is reached.\n\nYou can use this information strategically in timing a sale of an asset. Even delaying a sale a few months can have a measurable impact on return metrics\n\n\nPrepayment Language\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac loan data, roughly half of all loans will be prepaid early. Since you’ve got a 50/50 chance of having to deal with a prepayment at some point, we need to plan for it. The best way to minimize the risk of a prepayment blowing up a deal is to de-risk the loan before it ever closes. Below are a few prepayment provisions to include in your negotiation with the lender.\n\nYield Maintenance and Make Whole Prepayments\n\nPar Prepayment Periods\n\nThe par prepayment period is the time leading up to the loan maturity when you can prepay the loan without penalty. This is usually 3 months, but we want to make this long as possible. I’ve seen periods as long as 2 years successfully negotiated, but you’re more likely to land on somewhere around 6 months.\n\nPrepayment Calculation Periods\nThis is how long we have to run the calculation for. We never, ever want to run the calculation to maturity. Whenever possible, run the calculation to the start of the Par Prepayment Period. If you can prepay without penalty 6 months prior to maturity, why would we calculate the prepayment through maturity? If our par prepayment window is 3 months long, we would have saved $153,891.41 in our above fictitious loan, or $308,650.08 if it was 6 months.\n\nDiscount/Replacement Rate Spread\nTry to get a spread added to the replacement/discount rate. I’ve seen many prepays with language allowing for Treasurys + 50bps, but obviously get that spread as high as you can. The higher the spread, the cheaper the prepayment. A 50 bps spread would have brought our 2.25% discount rate to 2.75%, saving us $623,413.97.\n\nKeep in mind these changes are cumulative — including both this and the prepayment calculation periods would save nearly $900K.\n\nWaive Penalty for Refinancing with Lender\nLet’s say you locked a fixed rate loan in the next couple of months. Your rate is going to be pretty high. If we enter a recession in the next 12 months and the Fed is forced to cut rates, you’re likely going to want to refinance. Unfortunately, there’s an inverse relationship between a prepayment penalty and Treasury rates. As those rates fall, your prepayment penalty will spike, and likely make it prohibitively expensive for you to refinance. Some lenders, especially local/regional lenders, will agree to waive the prepayment penalty in the event that the refinancing is done with them.\n\nDefeasance\n\nPortfolio Length & Par Prepayments\nSimilar to the above, make sure to negotiate as long of a par prepayment period as possible. You also only want to structure the security portfolio through the end of the defeasance period.\n\nSuccessor Borrower Designation\nThis is arguably the most important term to negotiate, depending on how much your lender will agree to with portfolio length and par prepayments. Because the defeasance is just a substitution of collateral, someone has to step in as a replacement borrower to the loan after you step out. This entity is the Successor Borrower (SB). The security portfolio generates revenue for the SB over its life, which is a value that can be sold for an upfront fee or revenue sharing agreement, offsetting some of the prepayment cost.\n\nSecurity Types\nSince we actually have to build a portfolio to compensate the security investors, we can’t artificially inflate spreads like with YM/Make Whole calculations. Instead, we want the basket of securities that we can pick from to be diverse as possible. These usually include different agency securities, like Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, or FHLB securities. The more your broker has to pick from, the more options they have to decrease portfolio costs.\n\n\nSummary\n\nFixed rate prepayment methods all follow the same core principles, understanding the concepts behind how they are calculated can help you improve your debt management practices and improve your deal profitability.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

The only way to fix this is to flip the ratio, by either increasing NOI or decreasing the cost of debt.</p><h4 id=\"what-to-do-if-you-think-noi-will-increase\">What To Do If You Think NOI Will Increase</h4><p>It’s reasonable to think that with high inflation, rents will rise along with that inflation. You may also have a plan to increase rents by more than contracted bumps. If this is you, there are a couple of options.</p><p><strong>Option 1: Ride It Out</strong><br>Just charging ahead is a valid strategy is this scenario, provided your cap rate isn’t that far below your cost of debt, and your projected NOI will bring your cap rate relative to purchase price above that cost of debt in the near term. Just keep in mind that if you can’t get rents up, you will be deflating your returns per the table above.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Reduce Your Leverage</strong><br>Admittedly, this is more of a hedge than anything else. Even if you think rents will increase, reducing your leverage can soften the blow of negative leverage if rents don’t increase the way you think they will. If things don’t go according to plan, it won’t be quite as painful.</p><p><strong>Option 3: Buy In Cash</strong><br><em>If this is an option for you</em>, it might make sense to just buy it in cash, and lever up later. This can preserve your returns now, and allow you to redeploy funds later once the property has revenue to support the cost of debt.</p><p><strong>Option 4: Use a Step Up Swap</strong><br>I like using swaps to fix rates for a variety of reasons, one of which is the flexibility you have to shape the rate over time. A step-up swap is a structure whereby the borrower buys down the rate on the front-end of the swap by increasing the rate on the back-end of the swap. For example, if you could lock a swap at 4.50% for 10 years today, you could buy down the first 3 years of the swap to 4.00% by increasing the rate last 7 years to 4.71–4.75%.</p><p>This strategy can give you some up-front relief on your debt service, and amortize it later when your property is more able to absorb it.

One of the highlights was the belief that 2022 was going to be the year of the “installation phase” for CRE — that is, a time when tech enabled owner-operators will begin to show signs of competitive advantage over peers less willing to adopt.\n\nWhile 2022 didn’t quite pan out according to VC expectations, there are some early signs that seem to be pointing towards this “installation phase”. CRETI found that more capital is being allocated towards companies with an eye towards financial discipline, or companies that have found their product-market fit and standing on their own. Another CRETI survey found that 20 percent of real estate owners and managers were in the early stages of their “installation phase”.\n\nWhile I personally believe we’re in the midst of a shift towards tech-enabled advantages for market participants, it’s unlikely that major competitive advantages will be seen this year. After all, adopting technology is one thing–learning how to use it effectively is another.\n\n\nBuilding a Tech Stack\n\nLast week we talked about why Debt Management should be considered its own market category. This week we’ll take a look at what it takes to build a debt management tech stack. We’ll also touch on the secondary systems that can support a fully-functioning debt management system.\n\nDebt Management Software\n\nMaybe this goes without saying given the title, but you need a way to track and work with your loan information. Combine it with live rates, property financials, covenant tracking, etc. If that platform can support lender compliance, even better.\n\nAccounting Software\n\nYou can’t run your business without it, and it provides critical property data. This will work with your debt management system to keep track of NOI data, verify loan balances against balance sheet information, and provide other accounting information necessary for lender compliance.\n\nInvestor Management\n\nThis type of software helps gather the portfolio performance information you need for your investors. Some platforms can even calculate distributions owed to your investors based on asset performance. This can complement debt management to manage your WACC.\n\nBudgeting & Valuation\n\nHelps you to make forecasts about your properties based on your assumptions and historical information. This can include comp data and budget assumptions. This type of data helps you predict the likelihood of defaulting on a loan covenant and front-run lender compliance.\n\nBusiness Intelligence Tools\n\nAs a general tool, this can integrate with and help you understand your data from a variety of sources. You should expect certain categories of software, like debt management, to include some level of business intelligence to help manage debt portfolios at an executive level.\n\nDeal Acquisition Software\n\nThis helps manage deal activity at the asset level. Track, manage, and complete deals before passing the debt information off to the finance team or a controller.\n\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nBuilding an effective tech stack is hard. My only real piece of advice is to take the time to understand what your company needs, and to build a tech stack with those primary needs served first. Your secondary and tertiary systems should serve and be compatible with the primary systems.\n\nLast thing — since I am coming at this from a Debt Management point of view, my next post will be able how effective debt management practices will make real estate more profitable.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

You’ve been warned…\n\nIt might surprise some readers how often debt comes as an afterthought in CRE. After all, it’s the asset management that’s the real value driver in this business.

Yes, asset management is the primary value driver in real estate, but the effects of debt management cannot be ignored in CRE’s operating profitability. In fact, let’s quantify the effects that bad debt management can have on a single deal’s profitability.\n\n\nThe Setup\n\nBefore joining the tech industry, I worked in a traditional consulting role in interest rate risk management for commercial real estate. One client of ours wanted to audit their debt management performance for the assets they sold during the last 5 years or so. My firm was engaged to evaluate whether they had made the correct interest rate/hedging decisions given hindsight and the information they had available at the time.\n\nIt’s important to understand that this company was NOT struggling. In fact, they had been killing it and was one of the more successful real estate firms in the country. But like all successful firms, they were interested in seeing how they could have done even better.\n\n\nThe Pattern\n\nThe first thing we did to evaluate their performance was to find out if their rate structures were efficient. This firm was pretty conservative when it came to interest rates, and preferred long-term, fixed rate loans. The vast majority of their loans were fixed rate, and nearly all had 7–10 year maturities.\n\nIn contrast, the average hold period for this firm was only 4–5 years.

I can’t recall the median cost per deal, so let’s run our own analysis, using a generic $25M 10x30 loan.\n\nWe’re going to follow the same pattern as illustrated above, and sell an imaginary asset from July 2017 to July 2022, that we had closed on 5 years prior using 10Yr, fixed rate debt that we locked at 2.50% + 10T.

This is a leveraged product though, so what we really care about is that number relative to our original equity.\n\n12.3% of Market Value / 25% Equity = 49.2% of our originally invested equity\n\nKeep in mind that this doesn’t even take into account the cost of the higher rate spread we would have paid.\n\nOf course, the ultimate affect on our IRR will depend on our asset management practices and whether we were able to increase the value of our property, but this is still a pretty big hit on our ROE.\n\nWait a minute…\n\n * What if I had actually held the asset for 10 years, isn’t the longer-term loan less risky?\n\nNot really, there’s a reason banks borrow short and lend long, because you almost always win as the short-term borrower.

During the periods you won, you would have been better off by a borrowing spread of 1.18% (saving you >10% of the loan amount over the loan’s lifetime). During the small number of times you lost, you would have lost by an average of 0.14% (or <1.5% of the loan amount of the loan’s lifetime).\n\nIn fact, if we assume that the average 5yr loan spread is only 15bps lower than the average 10yr loan spread, then the number of times you lost would have all but disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile asset management is key to driving value in CRE, you can’t ignore the debt. In fact, implementing just a few simple debt management strategies can significantly improve your firm’s profitability and provide you with a competitive edge.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

How would that compare to your average debt maturity?\n\nBack in my consulting days, I worked with a firm to analyze their borrowing and disposition habits. The decision makers of this firm tended to be very conservative, preferring long-term, fixed rate financings, usually 7–10 years in length. However, after reviewing their portfolio we discovered their average hold period for a property was only 4–5 years. On an average deal, this would result in ~50% of the original equity amount being lost to overpaying interest and prepayment penalties.\n\nA loan’s prepayment penalty will have an outsized impact on your project’s returns. This is especially important if you have fixed rate debt. Almost all loans have a penalty of at least 1% of the outstanding loan amount, which can be as much or more than the origination fee! Almost all fixed rate loans have a rate-based penalty, which can easily be 10% or more of the total loan amount, depending on how early you prepay.\n\nThis is in addition to the additional interest expense for locking a rate for longer than what you would need. Borrowing for a longer term is more expensive than borrowing for a shorter term >90% of the time, no matter how you slice it (fixed vs floating, 5x5 ARM vs 10yr fixed, etc).\n\nSimply aligning your disposition and borrowing habits can go a long ways towards ensuring more optimal debt structures.\n\nDebt Optimization Strategies\n\nThis one will take a little discipline to do by hand, but isn’t a large time commitment to do on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. It works really well for minimizing your cost of debt within an equity fund or an entire portfolio.\n\nThe concept is simple, we want to minimize the cost of debt across our portfolio, not just individual assets. We can use well-performing assets to get cheaper funds to pay off more expensive debts on other properties.\n\nFor example, let’s say we have a portfolio of multi-family assets. Property A is funded by a senior loan at 4.50%, with a $2M mezz loan at a cost of 9%. Property B closed with Freddie Mac 3 years ago, and now qualifies for a $2M supplemental loan at 5%.

However, a few simple practices can have large, positive impacts on our net profit, and therefore our investor returns/distributions. This can make you more competitive than your peers in winning deals or raising money.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

If you cannot answer those questions with specificity, then we have too much ambiguity in our strategy.\n\nYou also have to know where you're starting from. Ambiguity sometimes comes from a lack of understanding your starting point, not a lack of knowing where you want to go. If you don't know where you're starting from, you're going to waster countless man hours and resources floundering for a foothold (anybody remember the Fire Phone?).\n\n\nValue Drivers\n\nIt's absolutely critical to understand your target customers and how you drive value for them. You have to know what that core competency is that you are the best at and how that creates value for a target customer.\n\nYour target market isn't aspirational, it comes from extensive research and testing to discover your target customer and what they care about. Your target customer isn't \"everybody\", or for B2B companies like mine, \"everybody in XYZ industry\". There's a specific type of customer with a specific problem, or set of problems, that your product can solve.\n\n\nNot Making Hard Choices\n\nThis is a big one. You can't be all things to all people. You have to make hard choices about what your core competencies are and who you're going to create value for. Avoiding the hard choices inevitably ends with a team trying to support conflicting demands. You have to choose.\n\nThis often stems from the idea that adding more and more features, you will automatically create more value out of thin air. Instead, you have to make decisions about what value you can create and then decide whether you can create features off of that.\n\n\nBad Strategy Will Happen\n\nBad strategy can and will happen to every company. Even wildly successful companies have their faceplant moments (a la Apple's Newton, or more than 280 products killed by Google). Just apply a little sanity testing and be aware of where your strategy missteps can come from. There's a lot of resources out there to help.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

                        "html": "<p>By now we've all heard about the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank. If you haven't, then this is a really odd place to be hearing about it for the first time.</p><p>This bank failure represents the second-largest in US history, but the way it failed is largely unprecedented (to my knowledge). This post is intended to be a primer on the long road to its insolvency, and whether this is an indicator of things to come.</p><h1 id=\"how-banking-works\">How Banking Works</h1><p>Before we can get to how and why SVB failed, it's important to understand how the business of banking functions. Banks have a really interesting business model, unlike any other business in the world. Most businesses make money by <em>selling</em> you something. A product, a service, etc. It might be something you produced directly, or it might be as a market-maker.</p><p>For example, Samsung designs and manufactures TV's. They make money by selling TV's for more money than it cost to produce. The economies of scale they operate at doesn't allow them to sell directly to consumers though, so they sell their product to wholesalers, which eventually makes its way down to a retailer. You, the consumer, can then buy your TV from Walmart, who also sells the TV for more than they bought it for.</p><p>While banks do have divisions that sell financial products, the way the business as a whole is stitched together is pretty unique.</p><h2 id=\"depositors\">Depositors</h2><p>If you decide to open your own bank, the first thing you're going to have to do is raise money from <strong>depositors</strong>. This can be individuals, or from other businesses. Depositors will place funds in accounts at your bank, and in exchange you agree to give them access to those funds anywhere in the globally connected financial world.</p><p>In return for offering that service, you don't charge a monthly fee, in fact you will often PAY depositors to keep their money in that account.</p><p>So, with that kind of a business model, how do you make money?</p><h2 id=\"collecting-assets\">Collecting Assets</h2><p>Banks make money in a variety of ways, but one of the primary engines of that income is by issuing debt, either on the primary market is the issuance of loans, or on the secondary market purchasing debt.</p><p>The idea here is that you will make more money on the products you lend than the interest you have to pay to depositors to keep money at your bank.</p><p>Pretty straightforward right? Except...</p><h2 id=\"fractional-reserve-banking\">Fractional Reserve Banking</h2><p>Ok, so this is where things get weird, and where things can get fragile. <strong>Banks lend out more money than they have cash on their balance sheet</strong>. How does this work?</p><p>Meet Joe. Joe is local businessman who owns a shop on main street. He decides to open a new account at your bank. He's been doing well, and has decided to move all of his bank business to you. He opens up the accounts he needs for his business and deposits $100,000.</p><p>Here's our current situation:</p><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Depositor</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Deposits</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Required Reserves</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Amount Available to Lend</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">Joe</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$100,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$10,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$90,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Ok, so we have something new here: <strong>Required Reserves</strong>. Even though we want to loan out Joe's money, we have to keep some of it on hand in case Joe needs it (you know, to make payroll). The Federal Reserve has regulations on the reserves that banks must have on hand for different financial products. For now, let's call it 10%.</p><p>Now that we have Joe's deposit, we can lend out up to $90,000 (Joe's deposit, less 10%). The next day, Emily walks in and wants to take out a loan so she can start up a business down the street. She's got a great business plan, and a track record of building successful businesses. You make the loan on the condition she does her banking with you. She agrees, and deposits her newly acquired $90,000 of cash with you.</p><p>Let's review where we are now:</p><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Depositor</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Deposits</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Required Reserves</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Amount Available to Lend</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Amount Lent</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">Joe</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$100,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$10,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">Emily</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$90,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$9,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$81,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">$90,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>$190,000</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>$19,000</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>$81,000</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>$90,000</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We have $190,000 deposited at our institution now. We are obligated to provide that cash to our depositors <em>on demand</em>. However, I've only got the original $100,000 in cash to cover those demands. If you carry this out to it's logical conclusion, I could actually lend out as much as $900,000 on the original deposit!</p><p>I'm sure the intelligent among you can see the problem. I could have as much as $900,000 in deposits I'm required to produce on demand, but I've only got $100,000 in cash to cover the demands.</p><p>If this is the first time you're hearing this, just know that the banking system of the entire world runs this way. This system runs smoothly so long as <em>everyone</em> doesn't want <em>all</em> of their money <em>at the same time</em>.</p><p>We'll get back to this soon...</p><h1 id=\"enter-svb\">Enter, SVB</h1><p>Silicon Valley Bank was founded on October 17, 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis. The idea was simple – they were going to cater to startups funded by venture capital. Once banking customers, they could add additional services to continue catering to these clients as they scaled their business.</p><p>The bank has had its ups and downs over the years, largely influenced by investment cycles. During the dot-com boom, their stock price soared and fell again as soon as it burst.

On Thursday, SVB seemingly botched an investor call that sent their stock price plummeting, and by Friday they were taken over by the FDIC. So what triggered this?</p><h2 id=\"the-dominos\">The Dominos</h2><p>First things first – nobody actually pays attention to what's going on at their bank. This includes the VC's and founders that used SVB for their banking. That is, until on February 23rd, Byrne Hobart's newsletter, The Diff, called out SVB for their less than stellar risk management situation.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1107\"></figure><p>Every VC on the planet reads Byrne Hobart. Every VC on the planet is also in the business of evaluating the viability of businesses, so after reading this they do what VC's do, and they started looking into this situation themselves.

It was a pretty standard looking bank presentation. You can take a look at it yourself <a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/589201576/files/doc_downloads/2023/03/Q1-2023-Mid-Quarter-Update-vFINAL3-030823.pdf\">here</a>.</p><p>First, if your bank is sending out a voluntary mid-quarter update, it's probably not good news. The first couple of pages they rip the band aid off and say that they're taking a big realized loss and then spend the rest of the presentation trying to convince you it's not a big deal.</p><p>It's a little bit like when one of my kids tells me they got an F on an exam, but it's okay because as long as they get a 55 on the final they'll still pass the class.</p><p>This, of course, spooked the hell out of not only their investors, but their depositors (and more importantly, the VC's that backed them).</p><h3 id=\"the-vc-scare\">The VC Scare</h3><p>Peter Thiel, USV, and Coatue send out messages to their portfolio companies to pull out funds from SVB. Cue the first couple waves of bank runs, but nothing the bank can't dig up cash for.</p><p>You can't keep this sort of thing a secret for long though (measured in hours, not days). Pretty soon, tech twitter catches word that all of their buddies have been told to get out, making them wonder if they should be pulling out as well. That's when the real bank run starts.</p><p>In the space of 48 hours, a staggering $42B in deposits are pulled out of SVB, roughly 25% of their base. I'm not sure even the most well capitalized banks are in a position for 25% of their deposits to evaporate overnight.</p><h3 id=\"back-to-fractional-reserve-banking\">Back to Fractional Reserve Banking</h3><p>Recall our explanation of fractional reserve banking above. The bank is fine so long as everyone doesn't want all of their money at the same time. What's interesting about SVB though, is their assets didn't really outstrip their deposits by all that much. Most of it was just stashed in Treasurys.</p><p>The problem was still the same though. They hedged badly (or rather, not at all), and when depositors came for their cash, the bank was forced to take a loss. That loss is sizeable for a bank their size.</p><h1 id=\"a-sign-of-things-to-come\">A Sign of Things to Come?</h1><p>So let's get this out of the way, is this a sign of things to come? Yes and no. Yes, there are going to be banks that hedged badly and got caught by the changing interest rate environment. No (probably), the largest banks that represent a systemic risk if they collapsed probably won't face any trouble. They're well capitalized, stress tested annually, have way better hedging strategies in place, and aren't diversified into a single, fickle group of depositors.</p><p>However, we can never say never. This could just be the first domino to fall. But let's also try to see this in context. SVB got pinched because they were too heavily concentrated in one type of clientele, and stuck all of their cash into an instrument that would expose them to interest rate risk without hedging the exposure.</p><h3 id=\"how-did-this-happen-arent-banks-regulated\">How Did This Happen? Aren't Banks Regulated?</h3><p>Yes, banks are regulated, but many of the regulations, hedging requirements, and reserve requirements only apply to banks with more than $250B in assets under management. This includes the annual stress tests that the largest banks in the country undergo each year. SVB fell shy of that, with around $212B at its peak.</p><p>I think the irony in all of this, is that their asset portfolio was ~50% Treasurys – they tried to do the responsible thing! Well, responsible from the perspective of a risk committee with little no risk management experience. What they didn't prepare for was the potential of having to realize paper losses.</p><h3 id=\"it-took-more-than-48-hours\">It took more than 48 hours</h3><p>SVB knew about this long before last week. They did operate without a Chief Risk Officer for most of the last 18 months, with Kim Olsen not joining until late 2022 – too late to do anything about SVB's precarious position.</p><p>The folks at Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahbarsky/2023/03/12/silicon-valley-bank-proxy-shows-boards-secret-yearlong-risk-panic/?sh=6a1976f91e7b\">released some disclosures</a> they believe point to some signs that over the last year, SVB was acutely aware of the position they were in.</p><ul><li>It's 2023 proxy statement called for <strong>seven</strong> of its 11 board members to serve on its risk committee, while no other committee has more than 5 members.

Their former CRO was moved into a non-executive role in April 2022, and a replacement wasn't announced until January 2023. </li></ul><h2 id=\"takeaways\">Takeaways</h2><p>There's a couple of things that make SVB's failure (and most recently, Signature Bank) unique from the banking sector as a whole:</p><ul><li>Each bank was concentrated in a very niche market. SVB serviced startups, and Signature was focused heavily in crypto. Both segments are coming out of recent boom cycles, leaving the banks exposed to a rapidly shrinking deposit base.</li><li>SVB tried to do the conservative thing and place deposits into Treasurys. A smart move, if their exposure had been hedged, or if they had rolled short-term investments to ensure they could always be no more than a month away from getting cash they needed.</li><li>The rumor mill killed SVB. Their collapse is putting every other bank under scrutiny, so there is absolutely some non-zero chance that some banks will face scrutiny from their depositors.</li><li>First Republic was suggested as an alternative by the same VC's that told their portfolio companies to pull their funds out of SVB (the same VC's that told them to put their money there to begin with). Not the kind of recommendation you want, sending their stock plummeting. </li><li>The Federal Reserve and the US Treasury is going to be going full-blast trying to reassure American citizens that the financial sector is stable. They've already back-stopped all SVB deposits, beyond the normal FDIC insurance of $250,000 per depositor. If you work for a startup that uses SVB, your employer will get access to their funds to make payroll. The Fed's primary concern, before inflation and unemployment, is ensuring the stability of the US financial system.</li><li>Interest Rates are DOWN.

Not guaranteed, just on the table.</li></ul><h1 id=\"the-story-isnt-over-yet\">The Story Isn't Over Yet</h1><p>This saga is still unfolding. Take everything above with a grain of salt.

                        "plaintext": "By now we've all heard about the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank. If you haven't, then this is a really odd place to be hearing about it for the first time.\n\nThis bank failure represents the second-largest in US history, but the way it failed is largely unprecedented (to my knowledge). This post is intended to be a primer on the long road to its insolvency, and whether this is an indicator of things to come.\n\n\nHow Banking Works\n\nBefore we can get to how and why SVB failed, it's important to understand how the business of banking functions. Banks have a really interesting business model, unlike any other business in the world. Most businesses make money by selling you something. A product, a service, etc. It might be something you produced directly, or it might be as a market-maker.\n\nFor example, Samsung designs and manufactures TV's. They make money by selling TV's for more money than it cost to produce. The economies of scale they operate at doesn't allow them to sell directly to consumers though, so they sell their product to wholesalers, which eventually makes its way down to a retailer. You, the consumer, can then buy your TV from Walmart, who also sells the TV for more than they bought it for.\n\nWhile banks do have divisions that sell financial products, the way the business as a whole is stitched together is pretty unique.\n\n\nDepositors\n\nIf you decide to open your own bank, the first thing you're going to have to do is raise money from depositors. This can be individuals, or from other businesses. Depositors will place funds in accounts at your bank, and in exchange you agree to give them access to those funds anywhere in the globally connected financial world.\n\nIn return for offering that service, you don't charge a monthly fee, in fact you will often PAY depositors to keep their money in that account.\n\nSo, with that kind of a business model, how do you make money?\n\n\nCollecting Assets\n\nBanks make money in a variety of ways, but one of the primary engines of that income is by issuing debt, either on the primary market is the issuance of loans, or on the secondary market purchasing debt.\n\nThe idea here is that you will make more money on the products you lend than the interest you have to pay to depositors to keep money at your bank.\n\nPretty straightforward right? Except...\n\n\nFractional Reserve Banking\n\nOk, so this is where things get weird, and where things can get fragile. Banks lend out more money than they have cash on their balance sheet. How does this work?\n\nMeet Joe. Joe is local businessman who owns a shop on main street. He decides to open a new account at your bank. He's been doing well, and has decided to move all of his bank business to you. He opens up the accounts he needs for his business and deposits $100,000.\n\nHere's our current situation:\n\n\n\n\nDepositor\nDeposits\nRequired Reserves\nAmount Available to Lend\n\n\n\n\nJoe\n$100,000\n$10,000\n$90,000\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, so we have something new here: Required Reserves. Even though we want to loan out Joe's money, we have to keep some of it on hand in case Joe needs it (you know, to make payroll). The Federal Reserve has regulations on the reserves that banks must have on hand for different financial products. For now, let's call it 10%.\n\nNow that we have Joe's deposit, we can lend out up to $90,000 (Joe's deposit, less 10%). The next day, Emily walks in and wants to take out a loan so she can start up a business down the street. She's got a great business plan, and a track record of building successful businesses. You make the loan on the condition she does her banking with you. She agrees, and deposits her newly acquired $90,000 of cash with you.\n\nLet's review where we are now:\n\n\n\n\nDepositor\nDeposits\nRequired Reserves\nAmount Available to Lend\nAmount Lent\n\n\n\n\nJoe\n$100,000\n$10,000\n$0\n$0\n\n\nEmily\n$90,000\n$9,000\n$81,000\n$90,000\n\n\nTotal\n$190,000\n$19,000\n$81,000\n$90,000\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have $190,000 deposited at our institution now. We are obligated to provide that cash to our depositors on demand. However, I've only got the original $100,000 in cash to cover those demands. If you carry this out to it's logical conclusion, I could actually lend out as much as $900,000 on the original deposit!\n\nI'm sure the intelligent among you can see the problem. I could have as much as $900,000 in deposits I'm required to produce on demand, but I've only got $100,000 in cash to cover the demands.\n\nIf this is the first time you're hearing this, just know that the banking system of the entire world runs this way. This system runs smoothly so long as everyone doesn't want all of their money at the same time.\n\nWe'll get back to this soon...\n\n\nEnter, SVB\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded on October 17, 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis. The idea was simple – they were going to cater to startups funded by venture capital. Once banking customers, they could add additional services to continue catering to these clients as they scaled their business.\n\nThe bank has had its ups and downs over the years, largely influenced by investment cycles. During the dot-com boom, their stock price soared and fell again as soon as it burst. In 2000, the bank gained a new CEO, Ken Wilcox, who chose to continue to concentrate in servicing tech companies instead of diversifying into a more traditional bank servicing model.\n\nBy 2015, the bank claimed to serve 65% of all US Tech startups, and many prominent VC firms.\n\n\nThe Pandemic\n\nAs many of you will recall, financial markets went through an interesting period during the pandemic. Instead of collapsing in the face of an economic slowdown, the stock market boomed. Armed with stimulus checks, a lot of people stuck at home began doing what every bored person with some extra cash does – they start gambling. This pushed valuations for public companies through the roof, and as a result, the VC business model become even more profitable.\n\nWith public valuations getting pushed ever higher, private valuations weren't far behind. Plus, without the votes of the masses influencing stock prices on Robinhood, private valuations can sometimes be even more insane than GameStop circa 2021.\n\nWFH meant more people were spending money online than ever before, and a new generation of entrepreneurs were ready to build new products for them to spend that money on. Those new products usually needed funding, and money was cheap (and often easy to get). It almost reminded you of the party scenes from The Great Gatsby – the money flowed and everyone had a good time.\n\nVenture Capitalists had a lot of money to place, and if you had a URL ending in \".ai\", you got a check. A big one, and Silicon Valley Bank was standing by ready to serve your needs. Over the course of 2020 into 2022, SVB's total assets swelled from $71B to over $211B – The 16th largest bank in the nation.\n\n\nTreasury Portfolio\n\nWith all of these new deposits coming in, SVB decided that instead of rushing poor quality loans out of the door, they would try to do the responsible thing and invest their depositor's money into the safest type of investment out there – US Treasury Bonds.\n\nAt face value, it's pretty smart actually. But they didn't execute on it very well.\n\nFor starters, as we all know, bond prices are inversely related to yields. Yields up, price down.

Their former CRO was moved into a non-executive role in April 2022, and a replacement wasn't announced until January 2023.\n\n\nTakeaways\n\nThere's a couple of things that make SVB's failure (and most recently, Signature Bank) unique from the banking sector as a whole:\n\n * Each bank was concentrated in a very niche market. SVB serviced startups, and Signature was focused heavily in crypto. Both segments are coming out of recent boom cycles, leaving the banks exposed to a rapidly shrinking deposit base.\n * SVB tried to do the conservative thing and place deposits into Treasurys. A smart move, if their exposure had been hedged, or if they had rolled short-term investments to ensure they could always be no more than a month away from getting cash they needed.\n * The rumor mill killed SVB. Their collapse is putting every other bank under scrutiny, so there is absolutely some non-zero chance that some banks will face scrutiny from their depositors.\n * First Republic was suggested as an alternative by the same VC's that told their portfolio companies to pull their funds out of SVB (the same VC's that told them to put their money there to begin with). Not the kind of recommendation you want, sending their stock plummeting.\n * The Federal Reserve and the US Treasury is going to be going full-blast trying to reassure American citizens that the financial sector is stable. They've already back-stopped all SVB deposits, beyond the normal FDIC insurance of $250,000 per depositor. If you work for a startup that uses SVB, your employer will get access to their funds to make payroll. The Fed's primary concern, before inflation and unemployment, is ensuring the stability of the US financial system.\n * Interest Rates are DOWN. Two-year Treasurys had dropped 100bps since Thursday, and are down by ~50bps as I'm typing this (Monday morning, 3/13/23). This represents the largest single drop in US history.\n * Emergency rate cuts are on the table to ensure the stability of the financial system. Not guaranteed, just on the table.\n\n\nThe Story Isn't Over Yet\n\nThis saga is still unfolding. Take everything above with a grain of salt. This is only based on the information that was available in the days following the collapse, so everything is subject to change in the face of new information.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

Strategy and planning aren't the same thing. Putting those two things together and giving it a catchy name doesn't help. It has nothing whatsoever to do with strategy.\n\n\nStrategic Planning\n\nWhen we talk about strategic planning, what we usually mean is describing a set of activities that we want to accomplish in order to achieve some out come.\n\n * We're going to improve user experience\n * We're going to market to a new type of user\n * We're going to open west coast office\n\nWe make these plans because they all sound good and we can easily understand them. But they're not really going to get us where we want to go, because they're not a strategy.\n\n\nWhat's a Strategy\n\nThe strategy definition that I like the best is defined as (I didn't come up with this, by the way, I'm not nearly clever enough):\n\nAn integrated set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win.\n\n\nStrategy is a Theory\n\nIt's really nothing more than a theory. It's a set of educated assumptions about why this is the playing field we should be on, and not some other one, and how we're going to be better at playing the game than anyone else on the field.\n\nThe strategic theory must be coherent, and it must be doable. You have to be able to translate that strategy into actions for it to be a great strategy. Planning doesn't have to have any such coherence.\n\nA plan is just the new set of features the sales team thinks they can sell, or what customer success wants to fulfil a client request, or what sort of new development environment engineering wants because it'll make some process faster, etc. It's an internal list of things that doesn't necessarily have any cohesiveness. What it's missing is some unifying mechanism that is going to help the company as a whole reach some goal.\n\n\nWhy Do Leaders Plan So Much?\n\nWe plan because planning is comfortable. It has a known value. Plans usually have to do with the resources you're going to spend. It's all on the costs side of the business. It's comfortable because I can control the cost side and I become the customer.\n\nStrategy involves making a plan about some goal we wish to achieve, which involves customers wanting our product or services enough to pay for them. The tricky part is we don't control customers. We can't make them buy our product or service.\n\nThat puts us out there, it makes us uncomfortable. We're saying that we have some belief about an outcome. We can't prove it in advance and we can't guarantee it.\n\nIt's much easier to say, \"I'll build this thing, I'll implement this policy, I'll hire these people\", than it is to say, \"I will have customers liking our product more than those of competitors\".\n\nThe trouble with planning is that at least one competitor is out there trying to figure out how to win.\n\n\nHow to Avoid the Planning Trap\n\n\n\nAccepting Angst\n\nRecognize that strategy will have some angst associated with it. Just accept it. You can't prove that your strategy will work in advance, while you can prove the cost of your plans. It's difficult to go to your boss and say, \"If our theory is right, and customers respond well to this, then we'll succeed\". Accept the fact that you can't be sure about the outcome, and that's okay. That's what leadership is about.\n\nNot knowing for sure isn't bad management, it's great leadership.\n\n\nLay Out The Logic\n\nLay out the logic of your strategy. What would have to be true about the playing field you're on in order for this strategy to work? What would have to be true about our customers, about our business model, our pricing model, the market environment, etc. in order for this to work?\n\nWith this in place you can watch your strategy unfold. Oftentimes our assumptions are not right, and we have to tweak the strategy. That's okay though! Strategy is a journey. We want to keep refining it to make it better and better as we go along.\n\n\nK.I.S.S.\n\nDon't make it overcomplicated. You strategy should be concise enough to fit on a sheet of paper, and simple enough to explain to one of your kids. I figure if my kids can get it, I'm not overcomplicating it!\n\nIt should lay out the basics: Here's where we're choosing to play, here's how we're going to win, here's the capabilities we need to have in place, and here's the management systems we need to succeed.\n\nHaving a strategy certainly won't guarantee that you'll win, but resorting to planning is a surefire way to guarantee you'll lose.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

However, the amount of collateral needed to secure that position is greater than the cash you need (due to market value of securities). This leaves banks in a bind when enough bank deposits get withdrawn.

One says it should keep hiking, and the other says it should start cutting. The Fed took the middle of the road path, neither committing to continued hikes (to bring down inflation), nor to providing rate relief to banks.

This last hike, and the expected hike in May, is just to build in some more dry powder to slash away. The Fed knows the banks will need emergency liquidity beyond a year at current rate levels, so their plan is to buy themselves enough time to let current rate levels do their work on inflation and let the banking sector issue become next year's problem.</p><p>Here's to hoping that they're smarter than me and not picking a priority was the right move...</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, consider following me and <a href=\"#/portal/signup\">subscribing to email updates</a> whenever I post an article.

                        "plaintext": "Last week, during the fallout of SVB, Signature Bank, and Silvergate, the FOMC decided during it's March 22 meeting to hike Fed Funds by 25 bps. This decision came pretty much in line with futures markets expectations, and signaled one more hike in May before pausing, also mostly in line with futures markets.\n\nDespite this seemingly expected behavior, markets reeled following the announcement, with the 10T falling 20bps between the decision and market close, and continuing a downward trend into Friday.\n\nThis is not the sort of response you expect for simply behaving the way markets expect you to behave. Why is this?\n\nBefore I get into why I think markets responded the way they did, let me just point out that I'm no macroeconomic expert, the FOMC more than likely consists of a panel of people much smarter than I. This is just a few observations I've seen pointed out by other commentators that make me wonder if the policy decision the Fed took was the smartest one.\n\n\nLet's Rewind\n\nLet's look back to why we're in this situation. We all know the storyline so I'll be brief:\n\n * 2019 - Life as normal\n * New virus, what's this?\n * Boom, COVID. We all go on lockdown, \"For 2 weeks, we promise\"\n * It's longer than that. WFH becomes a thing.\n * We have a short deflationary period as we adjust to a new way of life.\n * Stimulus checks to keep things moving. Most of us don't need it, so we buy $GME instead.\n * More stimulus checks\n * Another one\n * Another one -- wait, aren't we past this now?\n * Inflation has been picking up. It's transitory though, we promise. It's because of the ships parked off the CA coast.\n   \n   * Nothing to do with pumping stimmy checks to people who don't need them to buy a shrinking supply of stuff.\n   \n * We keep watching grocery bills go up for a year, but the Fed doesn't do anything because, \"Inflation is Transitory\".\n * Fast forward after a year of hearing the word \"transitory\" more times in 12 months than I've ever heard it in the rest of my life combined, and the Fed admits it was wrong.\n * We're behind the 8-ball though, so we've gotta hike, we've gotta hike fast, and we've gotta do it now.\n * Mar 2022 - Mar 2023, Fed Funds moves from 0.25% to 5.00% upper bound.\n * Mar 2021 - Mar 2023, the 10T moves from ~1.60% to ~3.40%\n\n\n\nInflation, Inflation, Inflation\n\nSo we're in the place we're in because the Fed has decided it's #1 priority is to keep inflation in check. That's the biggest problem facing the long term economic health of the United States.\n\nMakes sense if that's your priority. If that's the big issue, I can take you at your word, let's fight inflation! Hike baby, hike!\n\n\nBank Failures\n\nI won't go into grueling detail about how and why banks are failing, but if you do want to read more, because maybe you're the last person to read anything about it, you can check out a detailed description here.\n\nFDIC Takeover: An SVB Primer\n\nIn case you need a refresher, here's a quick recap of the banking sector stress.\n\n\nFalling Deposits\n\nBank deposits are the lifeblood of banks. When you go put your money in a bank, it allows the bank to deploy those assets into something that can make money. For basically all of banking history, deposits have only GROWN. Even back in 2007 - 2008, bank deposits grew at banks, they never decreased.\n\nHowever, if you squint your eyes and glance towards the right side of this graph, you'll see a big spike in bank deposits where deposit growth accelerated off-trend (you'll see my very scientific trend line in red).\n\nLet's forget for a moment about why deposits spiked, we can argue about that for days. I just want to point out that there seems to be some artificial acceleration away from the historical trend, and if that's the case, then this pull back down may have been unavoidable. In fact, if we argue mean-reversion, we may not even be close to the end of deposit deflation.\n\nIn fact, if we zoom into this chart, we can see that deposits at banks peaked about 9 months ago.\n\n\nOur Challenge: Making Depositors Whole\n\nOk, so if we're a bank, deposits across our entire industry are falling. That means to fix our problem we either need to a) keep deposits from falling, or b) liquidate some assets for cash.\n\nGiven that falling deposits are a problem across the entire banking sector and not just our bank, we're unlikely to fix that problem. The only banks who have a hope of at least maintaining their deposits are the Big 4 banks (JPM, BofA, WFC, and Citi), who may benefit from a flight from smaller institutions that are seen as more risky.\n\nWith that in mind, let's take stock of our situation.\n\n\nConsumer Loans\n\nAs bank, I issue consumer debt. Things like Credit Cards and HELOC loans. Those balance have risen and continue to rise. I make those loans with depositor money, which is leaving in droves.\n\n\n\nThose probably aren't going to go back down of their own accord. If we check the unused balances of those revolver lines we see the amount of credit offered continue to rise alongside the amount of credit used. Yikes.\n\n\n\nThe Prime rate, which nearly all consumer revolving debt is based around, steps up in lockstep with Fed Funds. As we all know, that's skyrocketed over the last year.\n\n\n\nWhat this adds up to is MORE debt that costs MORE to maintain, which means less cash to pay down balances (since more is going to interest), so this credit increase is unlikely to subside on its own. Higher interest also means higher minimum payments, which takes more money out of my bank account (deposits).\n\nOk, so unless we start calling in credit limits and cancelling HELOCs, this isn't a great place to start. I'm already losing deposits right and left, I can't risk giving my depositors yet another reason to leave, so this is probably a non-starter.\n\n\nConsumer Mortgages\n\nIn theory, this should be a good place to turn. We just stop originating or buying new mortgages, and just let refi's roll off our books.\n\nTrouble is, this seems to be everyone else's playbook too. The most recent data we have on this is Q3 2022, but even then originations were trending down. I bet when Q1 2023 data comes out we'll see a massive slump downward.\n\n\n\nBut of course, in this rate environment, who is going to refi of their own accord? Currently, mortgage rates are floating between 6% and 7%.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, only ~9% of mortgages (as of Q3 2022) were north of 6%. I doubt any rational person is refinancing their loans.\n\n\n\nThe only people paying off their mortgages are those who are selling their homes. Of course, home sales are falling as mortgage rates rise, so the loans you need to roll off are rolling off at a slower rate than in recent history.\n\n\n\n\nValuing Mortgages\n\nIf you remember bond math from college, you'll recall that the price you pay for a bond is correlated to the bond's coupon and the yield you're looking to gain.\n\n * If the bond's coupon = the bond yield, you buy the bond at par (i.e. face value)\n * If the coupon > yields, you buy the bond at a premium (i.e. more than face value)\n * If the coupon < yields, you buy the bond at a discount (i.e. less than face value)\n\nIf you're a bank with these loans in a balance sheet, you've got quite the dilemma. You can't get borrowers to refinance their loans with somebody else, and you can't assign your position either, because you'll take a pretty hefty loss. If your balance sheet is something similar to the national average, that means you can't assign your position to 90% of you mortgage portfolio without taking a loss.\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate Debt\n\nThis is a big issue for small banks. According to the Fed, nearly 70% of CRE loans are held by banks outside of the 25 largest. As of Feb, that's 70% of $2.898 TRILLION, which is still north of $2T.\n\nIf you're a bank looking to assign a loan position, you're more than likely going to use a calculation called Cash Equivalency -- the amount of cash paid or received to assign a position. It's pretty similar to bond math, and the premium/discount relationships are the same.\n\nHistorically, roughly 50% of CRE debt is fixed, and roughly 50% is floating. This means that at least half of your portfolio is going to be deeply affected by the long-term treasury moves. If you're a really small bank, your ratio probably leans fixed. Let's take a look at where you would have been underwriting loans the last few years.\n\nSo we've underwritten our loan portfolio in the following:\n\n * 2020 vintage: sub 1% Treasury Rates\n * 2021 vintage: dancing around 1.50% treasury rates\n * 2022 vintage: we start the year at ~2% and end ~4%\n\nDo you know any CRE operators who didn't refinance every single loan they possibly could in their debt portfolios in 2020 - early 2022?Ignoring spreads for a moment, every single loan we've underwritten in the last several years just keeps getting devalued. I think it's safe to say that at least 50% of outstanding CRE loans were underwritten since Jan 2020, meaning small banks are left holding the bag on loans they can't liquidate to appease depositors that are drawing down funds en masse.\n\n\nA Perfect Storm\n\nIf you've been listening to debt brokers, you know banks are in risk management mode -- this means no new loans, which means less credit is being spent (worsening the cash spend/drawing down deposit problem), and a potential credit crisis is looming.\n\nIf banks can't lend new money because deposits are dropping, and the 2023 debt maturity wall that everyone is talking about is looming, then how are CRE borrowers going to refinance their properties? If borrowers can't refinance their properties, how are banks (small banks in particular) going to roll that debt off their balance sheet to get liquidity?\n\nOnly time will tell, but this problem of shrinking deposits doesn't seem like it's going to resolve itself anytime soon.\n\n\nConflicting Priorities\n\nNow the Fed has two big issues to contend with.\n\n * A suffering banking sector that desperately needs some interest rate relief to get some liquidity. This priority would call for an DECREASE in rates.\n * An economy reeling from 2 years of historically high inflation. The only tool the Fed has to control inflation is interest rate policy.

A map of NYC is not NYC. It's a shadow of the thing it's trying to represent, and requires interpretation in order to understand it. AI will always struggle with this problem. AI cannot experience reality the way you and I do, it only has the representation to go off of. This is one of the reasons why image generators are so bad at drawing hands, it doesn't <em>actually know what a hand is, just what a picture of a hand looks like</em>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://170.187.153.50/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/DALL-E-2023-05-01-16.21.17---a-realistic-image-of-two-shaking-hands-in-the-middle-of-the-frame.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\"></figure><p>At it's core, AI is just a probability model (if you listen closely, you can hear a herd of angry AI engineers, <em>\"it's more than that!!!!\"</em>). So when you ask it to generate a picture of shaking hands, the above does fit the bill. It's statistically close to a <em>picture</em> of two shaking hands, but it's oddly off putting to us because it's not close at all to reality. Because we've seen hands and held or shook one before, we know what that interaction should look and feel like – it's trivial for we humans to see that something is off about that. But AI will never quite be able to solve it.</p><p>Of course, we can make attempts to make the problem better. Just give the model a 3D model of a human and let it compare a 3D rendering of the action to the output image and airbrush the image a little bit. That's a valid approach to solving that problem, but even that 3D model is just a map of the territory. Even if we got it to get good enough for what we need, it's still just one problem solved with a lot of <em>human effort</em>. Hardly the massive human displacement we're so concerned about.</p><p>Thinking about every nuanced problem millions of people are employed to solve every day, and you start to see why I'm skeptical that people are <strong>replaced</strong> in their jobs.</p><h1 id=\"superhuman\">Superhuman</h1><p>Before I finish, I want to stress that I don't think AI is useless, or that it's low quality garbage. It's not. This is one of the most exciting times to be in technology in the last 30 years or so.</p><p>If history teaches us anything, it's that technological innovation tends to just make us more productive as a species. Knowledge workers are long overdue for a productivity boost. For readers that have been in your industry for a long time, how has your productivity changed in the last 20 or 30 years? If you're in CRE, how many more deals are you able to execute on now than a couple decades ago? If you're in tech, are you able to ship features any faster? I have no doubt marginal gains have been made, but beyond improvements in your own skills and experience, has your ability to get knowledge work done improved exponentially? Probably not.</p><p>That's the real AI revolution. It's not replacing humans, it's making superhumans.</p><p>Will some people lose their jobs? I'm sure they will, that tends to be the way of destructive innovation. But the people who learn to embrace the revolution instead of fighting it will succeed. They will be the people to reap the benefits this new superpower is going to give them.</p><p>We're going to be okay. Humans always find ways to adapt.

If you're in CRE, how many more deals are you able to execute on now than a couple decades ago? If you're in tech, are you able to ship features any faster? I have no doubt marginal gains have been made, but beyond improvements in your own skills and experience, has your ability to get knowledge work done improved exponentially? Probably not.\n\nThat's the real AI revolution. It's not replacing humans, it's making superhumans.\n\nWill some people lose their jobs? I'm sure they will, that tends to be the way of destructive innovation. But the people who learn to embrace the revolution instead of fighting it will succeed. They will be the people to reap the benefits this new superpower is going to give them.\n\nWe're going to be okay. Humans always find ways to adapt. This time will be no different.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

To be clear, I don't think I'm wrong about it taking over half your job, but I think I was wrong about the impact it's going to have on developers.</p><p>Since ChatGPT came out, and we've gotten a taste of what a well-trained, commercial LLM product can do, I've kind of viewed this as a net-neutral impact on the developer community. After all, I haven't heard from a single company yet that they're short of things to go on their roadmap – they're just going to accelerate their plans.</p><p>Sure, we've seen <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/tech-industry-layoffs/\">massive tech layoffs</a>, but those were all economic layoffs from Big Tech, not productivity problems. Those were problems of <strong>focus</strong> at the top, not a problem with output from the bottom. The layoffs from Big Tech have created <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/03/03/big-tech-layoffs-a-hiring-opportunity/?sh=5e13aefa78c9\">massive hiring opportunities for startups</a>, and led to a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tech-layoffs-are-feeding-a-new-startup-surge/\">surge in new startups</a>. This is the impact of economic forces, not AI, but it's indicative of what's to come.</p><h1 id=\"the-ai-revolution\">The AI Revolution</h1><p>Ok, punch line first. The AI revolution is going to <strong>increase</strong> the number of developers, not decrease them.</p><p>When we evaluate this hypothesis, I want to be clear that this is in reference to the total number of people employed as developers, or have a hand in development work, NOT that individual companies will hire more developers. In fact, I would argue that the number of developers per company will stay the same or drop, but due to economic reasons, not technical ones.</p><p>This is going to come about because of several reasons:</p><ol><li>Decreased Barriers to Entry</li><li>The Rise of Low-Code and No-Code</li><li>Product Niches</li></ol><h1 id=\"decreased-barriers-to-entry\">Decreased Barriers to Entry</h1><p>The prevailing argument towards AI decreasing the number of developer roles is that AI will prove itself an example of <strong>Disruptive Innovation</strong>, sometimes referred to as destructive innovation. This scary naming comes from the fact that certain jobs are destroyed whenever a new type of technology is developed.</p><p>For example, the tractor destroyed farming as a way of life for millions. It transformed our way of life positively, moving us from an agrarian society into an industrial one, with better incomes and a better quality of life. However, it temporarily displaced a lot of workers who suddenly found themselves not needed to tend to crops.</p><p>There's countless other examples, but I want to stick to the tractor for this evaluation. The tractor has made farming so efficient that you can't make a living farming without one. However, the tractor presents a massive barrier to entry. Planting most crops involves the use of a class of equipment called row tractors. These are the machines that can plant, well, rows of different crops.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614977645540-7abd88ba8e56?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGpvaG4lMjBkZWVyZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxMDYyNzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1502\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614977645540-7abd88ba8e56?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGpvaG4lMjBkZWVyZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxMDYyNzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614977645540-7abd88ba8e56?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGpvaG4lMjBkZWVyZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxMDYyNzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614977645540-7abd88ba8e56?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGpvaG4lMjBkZWVyZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxMDYyNzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614977645540-7abd88ba8e56?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGpvaG4lMjBkZWVyZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxMDYyNzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Photo by </span><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/fr/@jkoblitz?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Julia Koblitz</span></a><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> / </span><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>The upfront cost of one of these machines is in excess of $100K, even for used machines.

It's a pretty simple app – it takes input from a user to create an org chart. Here's the thing, I didn't write a single line of code.</p><p>I asked ChatGPT (GPT4) the following question:</p><pre><code>Create for me a javascript script that will create an org chart. The user should be able to enter in the name, title, and person they report to into a form to add a node. Each node should have a connector that connects the nodes together. Generate the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in separate scripts.</code></pre><p>It then created for me some code that I was able to test using CodePen. It took some tweaking (again, not from me – ChatGPT made all the code changes when I requested them). Eventually, it created a workable demo that I was able to use. This isn't perfect, but it's getting better. Tools like AutoGPT make it possible to connect different models together and follow multi-step process independently. Work is being done on these code generation models to allow models to recursively test and update their own code so that the desired outcome is produced.</p><p>Here's a demo of the code ChatGPT produced to give you an idea of what's possible, just a few months into the AI revolution. I didn't write a single character of this code (not that I could if I wanted to), it's just a copy/paste of the code the GPT4 model produced. I had to ask it to fix a couple of things, and if I spent a little more time on it I'm sure I could fix a few other issues with it. But it's still pretty impressive that in 5 min, someone like me could take a generic LLM and produce functioning code.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ExdpmPM\" src=\"https://codepen.io/Caleb-Lewallen/embed/preview/ExdpmPM?default-tabs=js%2Cresult&amp;height=300&amp;host=https%3A%2F%2Fcodepen.io&amp;slug-hash=ExdpmPM\" title=\"ChartGPT\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden;\"></iframe></figure><p>Given a few months (or weeks, given the pace of AI innovation these days), more specialized tools are going to come out that put the power of <em>good </em>code generation into the hands of idiots like me who can just tell it step by step what I want and what tweaks to make and create a functioning app.</p><blockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\">This doesn't just lower the barrier to entry, it almost eliminates any technical barriers to entry.</blockquote><p>There's countless examples of this sort of practice occurring. One recent example that comes to mind is the easy access to financial markets, made possible by free trading from user-friendly apps like Robinhood and Webull. Only a few years prior, if you wanted to get involved in financial markets you would need to use a cumbersome brokerage platform that would take a long time to learn, and THEN pay $8 for the privilege of entering or exiting a position. Lockdown and stimulus in 2020 definitely contributed to the mayhem, but the easy access to markets was the catalyst that made it all possible.</p><p>The AI revolution will be no different. It's all building up to become the perfect storm. Big tech laying off thousands of skilled developers, who are either being scooped up by startups, or making companies of their own. Rising interest rates seem to be pushing us towards a recession, which will put others in the non-tech world out of work. Do you think unemployment and free access to ChatGPT or Bard is going to create more people trying to create software products, or less?</p><h1 id=\"the-rise-of-low-code-and-no-code\">The Rise of Low-Code and No-Code</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535551951406-a19828b0a76b?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fG5vJTIwY29kZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxNTI3NzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Papercraft toy in front of PHP echo statement\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1341\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535551951406-a19828b0a76b?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fG5vJTIwY29kZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxNTI3NzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535551951406-a19828b0a76b?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fG5vJTIwY29kZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxNTI3NzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535551951406-a19828b0a76b?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fG5vJTIwY29kZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxNTI3NzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535551951406-a19828b0a76b?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fG5vJTIwY29kZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2ODQxNTI3NzJ8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Photo by </span><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kobuagency?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">KOBU Agency</span></a><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> / </span><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>I know, it takes more than just a chat bot pushing out code snippets to build a product.

This makes an expensive barrier to entry even if you already know how to code.</p><p>Most no-code platforms are built on shared resources, meaning you're sharing a pool of compute and storage resources with a bunch of other applications.

To be clear, I don't think I'm wrong about it taking over half your job, but I think I was wrong about the impact it's going to have on developers.\n\nSince ChatGPT came out, and we've gotten a taste of what a well-trained, commercial LLM product can do, I've kind of viewed this as a net-neutral impact on the developer community. After all, I haven't heard from a single company yet that they're short of things to go on their roadmap – they're just going to accelerate their plans.\n\nSure, we've seen massive tech layoffs, but those were all economic layoffs from Big Tech, not productivity problems. Those were problems of focus at the top, not a problem with output from the bottom. The layoffs from Big Tech have created massive hiring opportunities for startups, and led to a surge in new startups. This is the impact of economic forces, not AI, but it's indicative of what's to come.\n\n\nThe AI Revolution\n\nOk, punch line first. The AI revolution is going to increase the number of developers, not decrease them.\n\nWhen we evaluate this hypothesis, I want to be clear that this is in reference to the total number of people employed as developers, or have a hand in development work, NOT that individual companies will hire more developers. In fact, I would argue that the number of developers per company will stay the same or drop, but due to economic reasons, not technical ones.\n\nThis is going to come about because of several reasons:\n\n 1. Decreased Barriers to Entry\n 2. The Rise of Low-Code and No-Code\n 3. Product Niches\n\n\nDecreased Barriers to Entry\n\nThe prevailing argument towards AI decreasing the number of developer roles is that AI will prove itself an example of Disruptive Innovation, sometimes referred to as destructive innovation. This scary naming comes from the fact that certain jobs are destroyed whenever a new type of technology is developed.\n\nFor example, the tractor destroyed farming as a way of life for millions. It transformed our way of life positively, moving us from an agrarian society into an industrial one, with better incomes and a better quality of life. However, it temporarily displaced a lot of workers who suddenly found themselves not needed to tend to crops.\n\nThere's countless other examples, but I want to stick to the tractor for this evaluation. The tractor has made farming so efficient that you can't make a living farming without one. However, the tractor presents a massive barrier to entry. Planting most crops involves the use of a class of equipment called row tractors. These are the machines that can plant, well, rows of different crops.\n\nThe upfront cost of one of these machines is in excess of $100K, even for used machines. When financed, the cost of the machine has to be amortized over 5 years. This represents a huge barrier to entry for anyone who wants to try and farm at scale.\n\n\nAI Lowers That Barrier\n\nThese GPT models are creating (at least initially) a much lower barrier to entry to create new software products. PHP/MySQL apps are going to always make money, and AI is going to make it easier than ever for non-developers to make these products!\n\nHere's a simple example. I'm not developer by trade. I've worked a lot with data over my career, so I'm familiar with SQL, and can sometimes scrape enough Python together to do a quick task, but I'm not someone who could make any form of functional software. At least until this afternoon...\n\nToday I decided to create a simple HTML app, ChartGPT. It's a pretty simple app – it takes input from a user to create an org chart. Here's the thing, I didn't write a single line of code.\n\nI asked ChatGPT (GPT4) the following question:\n\nCreate for me a javascript script that will create an org chart. The user should be able to enter in the name, title, and person they report to into a form to add a node. Each node should have a connector that connects the nodes together. Generate the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in separate scripts.\n\nIt then created for me some code that I was able to test using CodePen. It took some tweaking (again, not from me – ChatGPT made all the code changes when I requested them). Eventually, it created a workable demo that I was able to use. This isn't perfect, but it's getting better. Tools like AutoGPT make it possible to connect different models together and follow multi-step process independently. Work is being done on these code generation models to allow models to recursively test and update their own code so that the desired outcome is produced.\n\nHere's a demo of the code ChatGPT produced to give you an idea of what's possible, just a few months into the AI revolution. I didn't write a single character of this code (not that I could if I wanted to), it's just a copy/paste of the code the GPT4 model produced. I had to ask it to fix a couple of things, and if I spent a little more time on it I'm sure I could fix a few other issues with it. But it's still pretty impressive that in 5 min, someone like me could take a generic LLM and produce functioning code.\n\nGiven a few months (or weeks, given the pace of AI innovation these days), more specialized tools are going to come out that put the power of good code generation into the hands of idiots like me who can just tell it step by step what I want and what tweaks to make and create a functioning app.\n\nThis doesn't just lower the barrier to entry, it almost eliminates any technical barriers to entry.\n\nThere's countless examples of this sort of practice occurring. One recent example that comes to mind is the easy access to financial markets, made possible by free trading from user-friendly apps like Robinhood and Webull. Only a few years prior, if you wanted to get involved in financial markets you would need to use a cumbersome brokerage platform that would take a long time to learn, and THEN pay $8 for the privilege of entering or exiting a position. Lockdown and stimulus in 2020 definitely contributed to the mayhem, but the easy access to markets was the catalyst that made it all possible.\n\nThe AI revolution will be no different. It's all building up to become the perfect storm. Big tech laying off thousands of skilled developers, who are either being scooped up by startups, or making companies of their own. Rising interest rates seem to be pushing us towards a recession, which will put others in the non-tech world out of work. Do you think unemployment and free access to ChatGPT or Bard is going to create more people trying to create software products, or less?\n\n\nThe Rise of Low-Code and No-Code\n\nI know, it takes more than just a chat bot pushing out code snippets to build a product. Have no fear, there's plenty of low code and no code products out there to bridge the gap between where you are and where you need to be.\n\nIt's no longer necessary to have any ability to code to create useful SaaS apps (although some conceptual knowledge is really useful). These platforms, like Bubble, WeWeb, WebFlow, Xano, and Backendless remove almost all of the technical barriers, like user authentication, security, and infrastructure maintenance from the hands of the app creators and allows them to focus on making cool products.\n\n\nEconomies of Scale\n\nOnce you have the code written, most SaaS apps are expensive to run. All of the EC2 compute time, database and S3 storage, serverless infrastructure, etc. cost a lot of money to run. If you've ever built a SaaS app you also know that most of the time those resources sit around underutilized. You're still paying for that dedicated EC2 instance, even when it's not running. This makes an expensive barrier to entry even if you already know how to code.\n\nMost no-code platforms are built on shared resources, meaning you're sharing a pool of compute and storage resources with a bunch of other applications. This is completely and totally fine for 99% of applications. From a cost efficiency perspective, this is even preferred.\n\nThis makes the cost of building these tools on low or no code platforms dirt cheap. All of these services do offer dedicated resource packages, but you only need to migrate to these more expensive tiers once you have the user load to demand it (and the revenue to pay for it). You can get an app up and running for FREE in most cases, only paying when you think you have something ready to be published and to show to the world.\n\nWe've very quickly knocked down both the technical barriers and economic barriers to creating new products. I can build a fairly sophisticated application in my pajamas, orders of magnitude faster than would have been possible just a couple of years ago. That's insane.\n\n\nProduct Niches\n\nThis is one of my absolute favorite charts ever.\n\nIt's called the product adoption curve. It's been around forever and is used to describe the types of customers you're going to encounter as you reach market saturation.\n\nMoving a product up the curve is pretty formulaic in strategy, albeit not in execution. The strategic approach to unseating an incumbent is to find a customer niche that your competitor can't serve very well (the customer niche is too small to matter for your competitor, their product is too generic to pivot towards that customer, etc). This niche is your foothold to storm the proverbial beach and take market share.\n\nThe AI revolution and the rise of no/low code tools is going to create waves of niche products. Wish your trading app was focused on only trading tech stocks? You can make a niche product for that. Wish your fitness app was focused on making you a better powerlifter? Strongman? Bodybuilder? Long distance runner? Sprinter? You can make a niche product for that.\n\nThe economic forces and incentives towards getting lots of niche products out the door that serve smaller groups of users are here. I can't help but wonder if the loud pundits crying out for regulating AI to prevent \"the loss of jobs\" are doing so out of compassion or self-interest?\n\n\nMore Devs, Not Less\n\nAll signs seem to point towards more people being employed to create software products, not less. I don't mean that there will be more people learning how to use an IDE to code the old fashioned way – those folks will still be needed, but gap between what you have to code the old fashioned way and what you can do with a new generation of tools is closing fast, being chipped away almost daily.\n\nWho knows, maybe one day your full time job, or side hustle, might just be building and maintaining a specialized piece of software.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

Outside of the talking heads on CNBC and the Fed dots in the quarterly SEP, do you have any data points to back up your point of view?</p><p>Thankfully, financial markets give us a view into the consensus view from billions of dollars of bets being made at any given time. We can use Fed Funds Futures contracts to calculate our own probability of a policy change.</p><h2 id=\"fed-funds-futures-contracts\">Fed Funds Futures Contracts</h2><p>Before we get into how to calculate the <strong>probability</strong> of a policy move, first we need to understand how Fed Funds and their corresponding futures contracts function.</p><p>Fed Funds Futures (FFF) are quoted as a price, not a rate. The rate is derived from the price by subtracting 100 from the price. For example, if the contract you're viewing is priced at 94.88, then the implied rate in that contract is:</p><p>\\[100−94.88=5.12\\]</p>\n<h3 id=\"contract-data\">Contract Data<a href=\"https://ratehike.caleblewallen.com/Fed_Funds_Futures#contract-data\"></a></h3><p>Contracts for Fed Funds Futures are quote monthly, and have an expiry on the last day of every single month. When you get quoted a series of these contracts, they'll look something like this:</p><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quote Code</th>\n<th>Expiry Month</th>\n<th>Price</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ZQM3</td>\n<td>06/01/2023</td>\n<td>5.1200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZQN3</td>\n<td>07/01/2023</td>\n<td>5.1750</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZQQ3</td>\n<td>08/01/2023</td>\n<td>5.2850</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZQU3</td>\n<td>09/01/2023</td>\n<td>5.2750</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZQV3</td>\n<td>10/01/2023</td>\n<td>5.2500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZQX3</td>\n<td>11/01/2023</td>\n<td>5.1450</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZQZ3</td>\n<td>12/01/2023</td>\n<td>5.0550</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I know what you're thinking, \"But isn't fed funds an overnight rate? How is the contract monthly?\" I'm glad you asked.</p><h3 id=\"contract-pricing\">Contract Pricing<a href=\"https://ratehike.caleblewallen.com/Fed_Funds_Futures#contract-pricing\"></a></h3><p>Fed Funds futures are quoted as the&nbsp;<strong><em>average</em></strong>&nbsp;fed funds settlement over a given month. So if FF is 5.125% for the first half of the month, and 5.375% for the last half, then the contract will settle at 5.25%.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/06/newplot--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"704\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/newplot--1-.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/06/newplot--1-.png 704w\"></figure><h3 id=\"fomc-meetings\">FOMC Meetings<a href=\"https://ratehike.caleblewallen.com/Fed_Funds_Futures#fomc-meetings\"></a></h3><p>How does this help us calculate the odds of a policy move? The FOMC has an iron grip over the front end of the yield curve. They decide what the overnight rate is going to be and uses a trading desk in downtown Manhattan to keep settlement prices within a given range. With this in mind, knowing that only a Fed action can influence those contract rates up or down by more than a bp or two, we can start piecing together the expected path of hike.</p><h3 id=\"step-1-collect-futures-data\">Step 1: Collect Futures Data<a href=\"https://ratehike.caleblewallen.com/Calculation_Walkthrough#step-1-collect-futures-data\"></a></h3><p>Below is a table of futures data.

                        "plaintext": "An interactive version of this article can be found here: https://ratehike.caleblewallen.com/\n\nHere's a question for you – as of late June 2024, how many rate cuts, if any, do you expect the FOMC to make by the end of this year? Outside of the talking heads on CNBC and the Fed dots in the quarterly SEP, do you have any data points to back up your point of view?\n\nThankfully, financial markets give us a view into the consensus view from billions of dollars of bets being made at any given time. We can use Fed Funds Futures contracts to calculate our own probability of a policy change.\n\n\nFed Funds Futures Contracts\n\nBefore we get into how to calculate the probability of a policy move, first we need to understand how Fed Funds and their corresponding futures contracts function.\n\nFed Funds Futures (FFF) are quoted as a price, not a rate. The rate is derived from the price by subtracting 100 from the price. For example, if the contract you're viewing is priced at 94.88, then the implied rate in that contract is:\n\n\\[100−94.88=5.12\\]\n\n\n\nContract Data\n\nContracts for Fed Funds Futures are quote monthly, and have an expiry on the last day of every single month. When you get quoted a series of these contracts, they'll look something like this:\n\n\n\n\nQuote Code\nExpiry Month\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nZQM3\n06/01/2023\n5.1200\n\n\nZQN3\n07/01/2023\n5.1750\n\n\nZQQ3\n08/01/2023\n5.2850\n\n\nZQU3\n09/01/2023\n5.2750\n\n\nZQV3\n10/01/2023\n5.2500\n\n\nZQX3\n11/01/2023\n5.1450\n\n\nZQZ3\n12/01/2023\n5.0550\n\n\n\n\n\nI know what you're thinking, \"But isn't fed funds an overnight rate? How is the contract monthly?\" I'm glad you asked.\n\n\nContract Pricing\n\nFed Funds futures are quoted as the average fed funds settlement over a given month. So if FF is 5.125% for the first half of the month, and 5.375% for the last half, then the contract will settle at 5.25%.\n\n\nFOMC Meetings\n\nHow does this help us calculate the odds of a policy move? The FOMC has an iron grip over the front end of the yield curve. They decide what the overnight rate is going to be and uses a trading desk in downtown Manhattan to keep settlement prices within a given range. With this in mind, knowing that only a Fed action can influence those contract rates up or down by more than a bp or two, we can start piecing together the expected path of hike.\n\n\nStep 1: Collect Futures Data\n\nBelow is a table of futures data. You can get this data from the CME Group. This data is publicly available on a delayed basis. That's totally fine, we're not trading on this information, we're just trying to get a pulse on how likely the market thinks a rate hike is.\n\nCME Group - Fed Funds Futures Data\n\n\n\n\npriorSettle\nvolume\nquoteCode\nexpirationDate\nproductName\n\n\n\n\n94.67\n0\nZQM4\n6/1/2024\n30 Day Federal Funds Futures\n\n\n94.67\n15\nZQN4\n7/1/2024\n30 Day Federal Funds Futures\n\n\n94.7\n978\nZQQ4\n8/1/2024\n30 Day Federal Funds Futures\n\n\n94.76\n616\nZQU4\n9/1/2024\n30 Day Federal Funds Futures\n\n\n94.855\n84\nZQV4\n10/1/2024\n30 Day Federal Funds Futures\n\n\n94.925\n15\nZQX4\n11/1/2024\n30 Day Federal Funds Futures\n\n\n95.03\n111\nZQZ4\n12/1/2024\n30 Day Federal Funds Futures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Get FOMC Meeting Dates\n\nPolicy Decisions are typically going to happen on predetermined meeting dates (outside of black swan events that require immediate action), so we'll need to cross-reference our futures data with our FOMC meeting dates to figure out when we can expect a policy change to occur.\n\nFor the remainder of 2024, these are the meetings remaining. The 2025 meetings won't get announced until closer to the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\nFOMC Meeting Dates\n\n\n\n\n2024-07-31\n\n\n2024-09-18\n\n\n2024-11-07\n\n\n2024-12-18\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get this data from the FOMC's website. Note that decisions are announced on the second day of the meeting, therefore you only need to collect the second date of each meeting.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Build Projected Rate Movements\n\nThis step involves taking our futures pricing and calculating the implied rates and rate movements that occur in a given month. Our goal is to calculate Fed Funds at the start of the month vs the end, and then seeing the difference between the two. We're going to make a few assumptions when we work with this data:\n\n * The Beginning Rate for a month is simply the Ending Rate for the prior month. The exception to this is when there are no Fed Meetings.\n * Rate movements only occur in months with Fed Meetings. Since we know the rate at the beginning of the month and the implied rate per the futures data, we can calculate the end rate with:\n\n\\[r_{ending} = ((r_{implied} / days_{total}) - (r_{begin} * days_{priortochange})) / days_{afterchange}\\]\n\n\n * We can only calculate probabilities as far out as we have planned FOMC Meetings. This means that as we approach the latter half of the year, we can only project out a couple of meetings until the FOMC publishes next year's meeting schedule.\n\n📉Check out live projected movements\n\n\nStep 4: Probability Tree\n\nCalculating the probability tree occurs in two stages. The first is in the 'Front Meeting', which is just the very next meeting after today. This done by dividing the expected rate change by the expected policy move. Historically, this is typically 25 bps, although in recent memory it has been by as much as 75bps at a time.\n\n\\[Policy Change Probability = Expected Rate Change / Expected Policy Move\\]\n\n\nAs an example, if the front meeting has an expected rate change of 12.5 bps, and we expect that the FOMC's policy change is 25 bps change, then we would say there's a 50% likelihood of a hike.\n\nAs we move further down the probability tree, things get a little little more complex, but not all that much more. In concept, what we're trying to figure out is the probability that we land on one of the nodes in the chart below. For example, in the n2 nodes below (representing 2 meetings ahead of today), what's the likelihood that we will have experienced 2 hikes (n2(++))? What about no hike and then a hike (n2(+))?\n\nThe way we accomplish this is by first calculating the isolated probabilities of each meeting. In other words, what's the likelihood of a rate movement for a given meeting, based solely on the expected rate movement?\n\nNext, we'll use those isolated probabilities to figure out if the anticipated policy change is a hike or a cut, based on whether the isolated probabilities are positive or negative.\n\nThe formula we'll use to calculate the probability of one of our nodes is: \\[(p_{hikeNow}*p_{noHikePreviousMonth}) + ([1 - p_{hikeNow}] * p_{hikePreviousMonth})\\] where 'p' is probability. If futures data indicates a cut, then you would simply reverse the direction of the formula.\n\n\nFor example, here's how we would lay out calculating the probability of a cut as of late June 2024.\n\n📐Check out the interactive probability tree\n\n\nPolicy Decision Prediction\n\nThis is probably the most straightforward of the concepts. Now that we have our probability tree built, we can start with deducing the project policy decisions.\n\nWe'll begin by marking the FF range we're currently in. We'll add up all of the probabilities above and below that range, excluding the value from the current range. Once the summed probabilities exceeds a pre-defined threshold (in my case, 50%), then we'll mark a policy decision and move our mark up or down into a new FF range. From that, we'll repeat the process. You can tweak this process according to your risk thresholds by adjusting the move threshold up or down.\n\nIn our example above, the July meeting shows 90% probability of no policy change. However, in September there's a 58% chance that rates will be 25bps lower and a 6% chance that rates will be 50bps lower, for a overall probability of 64% that there will be a policy move down by the September meeting.\n\n📊Check out the live Policy Decision Prediction\n\n\nThat's it?\n\nThat's it! With some statistics and a little patience, we can calculate our own probabilities. While the Fed is projecting only one rate cut by the end of this year, our calculations show that the market is betting on two cuts.\n\nIf you liked this article, consider following me and subscribing to email updates whenever I post an article.

This is the tradeoff against having to maintain and deploy changes against a monolithic application.</p><p>What would make this better, is if each service could just read the data it needs from everyone's data stores when its needed – too bad traditional databases just don't allow for that. What if I could just have a single copy of the data and read from it wherever I need to?</p><h1 id=\"open-table-formats\">Open Table Formats</h1><p>Enter the Open Table Format (OTF). The major benefit that we care about for our use case is that an OTF allows us to separate the physical data that we want to read from the compute needed to read it. This separation of concerns is called <strong>virtualization</strong>. This virtualization allows different resources to be shared more efficiently.</p><p>The OTF does two key things:</p><ol><li>It separates <strong>data</strong> from its <strong>metadata</strong>, and</li><li>separates <strong>storage</strong> from <strong>compute</strong>.</li></ol><p>Table metadata is information about the table itself – where the data is, how it's organized by table and column names, column indexes, and the like. It's the table of contents for a database engine. By separating this away from the raw data beneath it, I'm able to send this metadata to distributed systems without creating multiple copies of the data itself.</p><p>This creates a number of benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Single source of truth.</strong> One common challenge in copying data is synchronization. Errors happen all the time – drives get corrupted, connections are interrupted, edge cases cause data to not copy as expected, etc. Ask anyone who's worked with Kafka events how flawless it can be. A single source of data means it's easier to prevent replication errors from happening and I'm able to operate from the same source of truth.</li><li><strong>Utilizing Object Storage.</strong> Believe it or not, the physical data in your database is just a file (often multiple files, but a file nonetheless). If we separate this from the compute and metadata, I can just stick the files in cheap object storage and not have to worry about complex storage management.</li><li><strong>Federated access.</strong> Data catalogs are pure metadata. They can easily be distributed across a federated system to grant access. The owner of the data can easily present the data to another system without copying data over.</li><li><strong>Standardization.</strong> Having a common format means that data can be collaborated on by multiple parties. Since the physical data is in a common format, multiple engines can process on the same data for different purposes.</li></ul><p>Thinking about these virtualization benefits yields some powerful implications. Being able to surface the <em>same table</em> in <em>different platforms</em> as if they were both native to the same platform is insane. With this capability, there's no need to move data between platforms, you just need to expose the tables needed to feed other platforms. Data access to peer services is truly <em>real time</em>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"988\" height=\"952\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-8.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-8.png 988w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"data-governance-access\">Data Governance &amp; Access</h1><p>Okay, so two systems having access to the same table sounds cool in concept, but what are the practical implications? I can already see someone raising their hand to tell me two systems shouldn't be able to access the same table. The chaos! It's anarchy!</p><p>Remember, these are just tools. How you use them is the key.</p><p>Tables come in two flavors. The first is a <strong>native</strong> table. This is exactly how you think about tables now. It's both the table metadata as well as the physical data itself. The second flavor is an <strong>external</strong> table. This is just the table metadata. It gives us the information needed to read the table without a copy of the data itself.</p><p>We expose this data to multiple systems by granting access to native and external tables. One system will have access to the native table, while one or more other systems can have access to the external table.</p><h2 id=\"data-sharing\">Data Sharing</h2><p>As a service or application, data sharing is two-way. You can share out, meaning you own the native table and expose table metadata to other applications. You can also share in, where you add external tables from other applications. In other words, the native table owner publishes metadata changes that the external table owner must subscribe to.</p><p>Once you have the metadata, then it becomes a matter of permissions for your typical CRUD operations. At this moment in time, I haven't been able to come up with a use case where I would allow an external table owner being able to do anything to the physical data except read it. Allowing external platforms to write to your table creates a host of support, data quality, and data reliability issues.</p><p>The use cases I've experienced so far revolve around a common pattern. There is a System of Record owner that publishes data changes that other systems need to react to. Right now, that's done via a batch file import or some event queue. In our composable data pattern, the SoR would write to a native table that other systems can read using an external table.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1153\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-5.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-5.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-5.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-5.png 2096w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Data that needs to be written back to the SoR should be handled in one of two ways. The first is to utilize typical messaging interfaces like API calls or message queues to let the SoR know it needs to write the data back to a native table. The second is that if we think the outside service should be writing that data, then we should evaluate whether that data truly belongs to the SoR.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1242\" height=\"745\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-6.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-6.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-6.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Do you see where this is going? Take an example where our customer platform from earlier needs to send a text message to a user, for which they use a communications microservice. If the text message is unable to reach the customer, then the bounce back data needs to be written and recorded back to the user. In our composable model, since the customer application isn't the creator of the bounce back data, the communications service can own the native table with the bounce back data, giving the SoR direct access via an external table.</p><h1 id=\"operational-data-and-analytics\">Operational Data and Analytics</h1><p>So far, we've really only looked at this from a SoR/transactional lens. What about as we get into data-specific uses like Operational and Analytical platforms?</p><h2 id=\"operational-data\">Operational Data</h2><p>A common data sharing primitive in the operational space is one of data streaming – directing messages to different microservices to take different actions, as well as consuming response messages from the microservices. This pattern can be conceptualized for our composable data platform in a producer/consumer pattern like so:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-12.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1368\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-12.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-12.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-12.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Using virtual tables to produce and consume event data</span></figcaption></figure><p>This approach differs slightly from the traditional approach to event-based microservices architectures in that the microservice isn't necessarily producing events, instead centralizing that responsibility to the operational data platform. This approach allows services within a given domain to simply read/write to database tables without needing to implement messaging protocols. Any events that need to be broadcast back to the enterprise is delegated to an operational platform.</p><h2 id=\"analytical-data\">Analytical Data</h2><p>I won't pretend to be an expert in the analytics space, I haven't spent nearly as much time in that area as operational data. However, given I know just enough to be confident in my ignorance, I'll let you tell me where this falls short.</p><p>The role of the analytical data function is in aggregations of long-term business datasets, pre-calculating expensive queries into something that can be easily consumable by end users. Usually this begins in the form of copying large quantities of raw data away from SoR systems into a place where we can clean and process data.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1469\" height=\"837\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-2.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-2.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png 1469w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The foundation of analytics is copying large amounts of data</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like before, one of the most expensive parts of this operation is copying large amounts of data to a separate store before we start to clean and conform the data into something useful. This results in a mountain of data that is really nothing more than a 1:1 copy of the original data. We haven't added any value yet and cost a ton in additional storage costs. Virtual tables allow the analytical space to incrementally read the raw data directly where it sits and store refined/conformed data in native tables.</p><h2 id=\"reverse-etl\">Reverse ETL</h2><p>There's a fuzzy line between analytical and operational data. In theory we like to consider these things like separate ideas, but in practice they often overlap. Like a report created from SoR data that contains a new derived dataset, that's consumed by the original SoR to perform new workflows.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1373\" height=\"716\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-7.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-7.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-7.png 1373w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>What's the common theme we find ourselves with once again? The physical copying of data. Two copies of the same data that are needed by different applications in the same system. More replication, more points of failure.</p><h2 id=\"data-fabric\">Data Fabric</h2><p>What we want to start shifting towards is a data \"fabric\", where we begin to think about tables in a logical ownership model rather than a physical one. With a data fabric as the model for our composable data platform, a native table can be exposed to any other system that requires access, so that the same set of data can be read and used by any system that needs it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1389\" height=\"1406\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-4.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-4.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/image-4.png 1389w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In our old model, our data access is restricted by physical and technological barriers. All operations have to be performed by the same application. In our new model, the physical location of the table is no longer important (save for latency issues with edge compute, but that's a different discussion). In theory, you could have the physical data for dozens of services all in the same object storage layer, with ownership distributed in a logical model.</p><p>To prevent this from becoming too chaotic and maintaining good data governance, we still want to interface with other domain areas of the enterprise through some sort of central data platform. An example for a financial services company might be separating domains around loan origination and servicing. The origination domain largely focuses on marketing, sales, and underwriting functions. Servicing shifts into daily operations. Each one of those business domains likely operates independently from the other, with a customer handoff between functions. In this case, I wouldn't want to mix domain data. I'd still consider an enterprise data interface to shift relevant data attributes between domain spaces. Once inside the domain, we can move back into our composable data structures. Your mileage may vary here, it will be up to you to determine how wide you want your data fabric to stretch.</p><h1 id=\"a-new-ownership-model\">A New Ownership Model</h1><p>With this way of looking at ownership and governance, our new focus is on how to present the data. It becomes less and less about how data should move from A to B, scheduling batch updates, what events should be published, etc. We no longer have to concern ourselves with different platforms with different capabilities and needs. There's no more siloed application data within a business domain – instead we define data ownership using a logical model. Our applications start behaving like a hive instead of as separate entities, and we can focus more on the logical constructs of our applications instead of how we're going to communicate between them.</p><p>Those of you that are starting to grasp the vision should see why this is such an appealing idea. I don't see any real barriers to being able to run complex systems this way. The most difficult thing to map out is who is the owner of a specific native table (i.e. who is the producer and sole authorized modifier of the data) and ensuring the external table is exposed to the proper users.</p><h1 id=\"fitting-into-your-data-strategy\">Fitting Into Your Data Strategy</h1><p>To be clear, this isn't a simple way to manage data for singular platforms. For startups and those with monolithic applications, my take is still to \"just use Postgres\" and be done with it.

If we separate this from the compute and metadata, I can just stick the files in cheap object storage and not have to worry about complex storage management.\n * Federated access. Data catalogs are pure metadata. They can easily be distributed across a federated system to grant access. The owner of the data can easily present the data to another system without copying data over.\n * Standardization. Having a common format means that data can be collaborated on by multiple parties. Since the physical data is in a common format, multiple engines can process on the same data for different purposes.\n\nThinking about these virtualization benefits yields some powerful implications. Being able to surface the same table in different platforms as if they were both native to the same platform is insane. With this capability, there's no need to move data between platforms, you just need to expose the tables needed to feed other platforms. Data access to peer services is truly real time.\n\n\nData Governance & Access\n\nOkay, so two systems having access to the same table sounds cool in concept, but what are the practical implications? I can already see someone raising their hand to tell me two systems shouldn't be able to access the same table. The chaos! It's anarchy!\n\nRemember, these are just tools. How you use them is the key.\n\nTables come in two flavors. The first is a native table. This is exactly how you think about tables now. It's both the table metadata as well as the physical data itself. The second flavor is an external table. This is just the table metadata. It gives us the information needed to read the table without a copy of the data itself.\n\nWe expose this data to multiple systems by granting access to native and external tables. One system will have access to the native table, while one or more other systems can have access to the external table.\n\n\nData Sharing\n\nAs a service or application, data sharing is two-way. You can share out, meaning you own the native table and expose table metadata to other applications. You can also share in, where you add external tables from other applications. In other words, the native table owner publishes metadata changes that the external table owner must subscribe to.\n\nOnce you have the metadata, then it becomes a matter of permissions for your typical CRUD operations. At this moment in time, I haven't been able to come up with a use case where I would allow an external table owner being able to do anything to the physical data except read it. Allowing external platforms to write to your table creates a host of support, data quality, and data reliability issues.\n\nThe use cases I've experienced so far revolve around a common pattern. There is a System of Record owner that publishes data changes that other systems need to react to. Right now, that's done via a batch file import or some event queue. In our composable data pattern, the SoR would write to a native table that other systems can read using an external table.\n\nData that needs to be written back to the SoR should be handled in one of two ways. The first is to utilize typical messaging interfaces like API calls or message queues to let the SoR know it needs to write the data back to a native table. The second is that if we think the outside service should be writing that data, then we should evaluate whether that data truly belongs to the SoR.\n\nDo you see where this is going? Take an example where our customer platform from earlier needs to send a text message to a user, for which they use a communications microservice. If the text message is unable to reach the customer, then the bounce back data needs to be written and recorded back to the user. In our composable model, since the customer application isn't the creator of the bounce back data, the communications service can own the native table with the bounce back data, giving the SoR direct access via an external table.\n\n\nOperational Data and Analytics\n\nSo far, we've really only looked at this from a SoR/transactional lens. What about as we get into data-specific uses like Operational and Analytical platforms?\n\n\nOperational Data\n\nA common data sharing primitive in the operational space is one of data streaming – directing messages to different microservices to take different actions, as well as consuming response messages from the microservices. This pattern can be conceptualized for our composable data platform in a producer/consumer pattern like so:\n\nThis approach differs slightly from the traditional approach to event-based microservices architectures in that the microservice isn't necessarily producing events, instead centralizing that responsibility to the operational data platform. This approach allows services within a given domain to simply read/write to database tables without needing to implement messaging protocols. Any events that need to be broadcast back to the enterprise is delegated to an operational platform.\n\n\nAnalytical Data\n\nI won't pretend to be an expert in the analytics space, I haven't spent nearly as much time in that area as operational data. However, given I know just enough to be confident in my ignorance, I'll let you tell me where this falls short.\n\nThe role of the analytical data function is in aggregations of long-term business datasets, pre-calculating expensive queries into something that can be easily consumable by end users. Usually this begins in the form of copying large quantities of raw data away from SoR systems into a place where we can clean and process data.\n\nLike before, one of the most expensive parts of this operation is copying large amounts of data to a separate store before we start to clean and conform the data into something useful. This results in a mountain of data that is really nothing more than a 1:1 copy of the original data. We haven't added any value yet and cost a ton in additional storage costs. Virtual tables allow the analytical space to incrementally read the raw data directly where it sits and store refined/conformed data in native tables.\n\n\nReverse ETL\n\nThere's a fuzzy line between analytical and operational data. In theory we like to consider these things like separate ideas, but in practice they often overlap. Like a report created from SoR data that contains a new derived dataset, that's consumed by the original SoR to perform new workflows.\n\nWhat's the common theme we find ourselves with once again? The physical copying of data. Two copies of the same data that are needed by different applications in the same system. More replication, more points of failure.\n\n\nData Fabric\n\nWhat we want to start shifting towards is a data \"fabric\", where we begin to think about tables in a logical ownership model rather than a physical one. With a data fabric as the model for our composable data platform, a native table can be exposed to any other system that requires access, so that the same set of data can be read and used by any system that needs it.\n\nIn our old model, our data access is restricted by physical and technological barriers. All operations have to be performed by the same application. In our new model, the physical location of the table is no longer important (save for latency issues with edge compute, but that's a different discussion). In theory, you could have the physical data for dozens of services all in the same object storage layer, with ownership distributed in a logical model.\n\nTo prevent this from becoming too chaotic and maintaining good data governance, we still want to interface with other domain areas of the enterprise through some sort of central data platform. An example for a financial services company might be separating domains around loan origination and servicing. The origination domain largely focuses on marketing, sales, and underwriting functions. Servicing shifts into daily operations. Each one of those business domains likely operates independently from the other, with a customer handoff between functions. In this case, I wouldn't want to mix domain data. I'd still consider an enterprise data interface to shift relevant data attributes between domain spaces. Once inside the domain, we can move back into our composable data structures. Your mileage may vary here, it will be up to you to determine how wide you want your data fabric to stretch.\n\n\nA New Ownership Model\n\nWith this way of looking at ownership and governance, our new focus is on how to present the data. It becomes less and less about how data should move from A to B, scheduling batch updates, what events should be published, etc. We no longer have to concern ourselves with different platforms with different capabilities and needs. There's no more siloed application data within a business domain – instead we define data ownership using a logical model. Our applications start behaving like a hive instead of as separate entities, and we can focus more on the logical constructs of our applications instead of how we're going to communicate between them.\n\nThose of you that are starting to grasp the vision should see why this is such an appealing idea. I don't see any real barriers to being able to run complex systems this way. The most difficult thing to map out is who is the owner of a specific native table (i.e. who is the producer and sole authorized modifier of the data) and ensuring the external table is exposed to the proper users.\n\n\nFitting Into Your Data Strategy\n\nTo be clear, this isn't a simple way to manage data for singular platforms. For startups and those with monolithic applications, my take is still to \"just use Postgres\" and be done with it. However, if you're in a large organization and need to federate data access across dozens of services, then a composable data platform approach using OTF's can radically simplify your tech stack and the way you operate.\n\nTo me, this type of data strategy fits into the \"just use Postgres\" mantra, but designed for the enterprise. We want to skip out on setting up and using messaging queues for most services and just query data. We want to allow our operational and analytical data platforms to read the data they need without having to invest in massive ETL compute and storage costs to create 1:1 copies of the same data. Services should read the data where it sits and move on with what they need to do.\n\nIf you liked this article, leave a comment and let me know!

                        "plaintext": "If you spend any time in your career building data products, you will inevitably work with some data folks who want to utilize an architecture that's almost ubiquitous with the very concept of the data lake itself. As the title has already given away, this is the medallion architecture.\n\nI, and many other data professionals, have plenty of criticisms of this approach to building data products. I'll spend some time diving into those at some point, but for now I want to talk about why this architecture just works. Despite some of its flaws, its robust and flexible enough to power almost every data lake and warehouse out there.\n\nThere are 10 reasons why I think this works so well. Some of these reasons are technical, but many are more practical in nature – why they're easier to build, and why they can make for a good data product.\n\n\nThe Medallion Architecture\n\nFirst, let's talk about what this architecture is. The beauty of this design is it can easily fit onto a single slide. Data comes in a raw state on the left and comes out ready to use on the right.\n\n\nBronze Layer\n\nThis is just a landing zone for data coming from its source. This might come in the form of direct SQL queries, data files, and/or event streams. Anything that you need to pick up gets dumped here. There are some optional steps you can do here, like converting everything into a standard data format or doing some light organizing (split flat files into logical structures, merging data sets, etc).\n\n\nSilver Layer\n\nThis layer is where we want to unify our sources into a common ontology. Really spend some time here to get this right, you'll save yourself so much time and energy later. Because you're pulling data from multiple source systems, data will be structured and named differently for each source. You will typically normalize your data into a single ontology here.\n\n\nGold Layer\n\nThe last step is kind of like taking a step backwards. We just spent a lot of time working up into a highly normalized structure, and here we're going to de-normalize it all over again. It's for a good reason though, many of the data sets we produce will be for a specific use case. It could be de-normalizing things into a flat table for query performance, or creating a very specific data set that requires a lot of complex business logic to produce.\n\n\n10 Reasons This Architecture Rocks\n\n\n01 - It's easy to understand\n\nSeriously, this is so simple it can fit on a single slide. Don't underestimate the benefit of being able to communicate your data strategy effectively, especially to folks who don't have a background in data. This includes both your technical and non-technical stakeholders. Business folks don't really care, and most technical folks think in terms of \"stateless\" functions – that is they think about logical structures first, and then try to backfill the data later.\n\n\n02 - It's a one-way pipeline\n\nThis moves all of your data in the same direction and doesn't branch off. Every dataset you work with comes along for the ride. This is really useful for coordinating efforts amongst multiple teams. There's a checklist of steps data has to go through, so you don't need to handhold everyone along the way.\n\n\n03 - It enforces incremental changes\n\nSince you can only move through one step at a time, each change to the data is incremental. This prevents you pushing too much complexity into any individual step. One step is creating common data formats, another step is performing quality checks, and another is creating logical schemas. It's easy to introduce defects you can't easily debug if you tried to do it all at once.\n\n\n04 - Its flexibility gives cheaper storage options\n\nStorage is cheap, but when you're dealing the volumes of data that made you think building a data lake was a good idea, then we're dealing with real dollars. Given the separate steps, you can use cheaper object storage for lower layers and more purpose-built database options for higher layers.\n\n\n05 - It gives multiple data assets for different users\n\nYour silver and gold layers are all accessible data assets. Data scientists might be interested in using your sanitized data from source to run direct queries, while business users might be interested in higher-level data sets that are purpose-built for them.\n\n\n06 - It's simple to govern\n\nI know, I know, data governance is rarely \"simple\". However, this architecture makes it straightforward to catalog, track lineage, and understand the ownership of different attributes in different layers of the stack.\n\n\n07 - It's resilient against source changes\n\nSince the bronze layer preserves the original data (often in a schema-less architecture), allowing you to tweak downstream layers while maintaining the original data, releasing the source data once the changes have been made.\n\n\n08 - It's horizontally scalable\n\nThe system isn't tied to any one particular monolithic process (although it can be, if that's what works for you), so you can scale different layers depending on how much data you move from one layer to the next.\n\n\n09 - It gives flexibility with compute\n\nOkay, this might be another take on #8, but it's worth calling out here. Some workflows, especially as you move into our silver and gold layers, might not need massively concurrent, horizontally scalable systems like Spark. Because each layer is separate, you can utilize something like a simple Python/Pandas/Polars script for smaller datasets, saving Spark for bigger workloads\n\n\n10 - It's easier to coordinate across multiple teams\n\nYou can assign different layers of work to different groups. You can separate work out by layer, by transformer, or by whatever differentiating factor you prefer. There's enough commonality that different teams are able to coordinate, but also enough differentiation between different types of workloads that different specialties can be assigned.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe medallion architecture is a time-tested architecture adopted across many organizations. There's a lot of resources out there to help you build your own data platform using this approach.\n\nNext, I'll take some time to talk about some of the shortcomings of this approach and how to solve for them.",
