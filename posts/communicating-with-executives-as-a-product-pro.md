This past week has been one of the most intense weeks I've had working in quite a long time. It was also an incredibly satisfying one.

# You're the Expert

If you've been asked to present before executives, you've been asked there for a reason. That reason is because you are the one with the expertise to provide information and answer questions.

The primary responsibility of an executive is to make decisions. They bear the weight of responsibility if the decision they make is a bad one, so they're counting on you to provide them with the information they need to make that decision. For that reason, you can expect some probing questions. These questions aren't meant try and stump you, but to make sure they understand (and sometimes to make sure you do as well).

Don't make up answers you don't know, and don't speculate to try and sound smart. If you don't know something, it's okay to say so. If you do make a speculation, make it clear that's what it is.
