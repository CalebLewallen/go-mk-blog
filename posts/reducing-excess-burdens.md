- Your job as a leader isn't just to direct employees, it's to make the work they do easier.
- You should be removing Excess Burdens, not creating them.
- An Excess Burden is anything you have asked of your employees that does not improve their ability to add value.
- This will be controversial, but for some companies that Excess Burden may be WFH policies for office (knowledge) workers.
- If we think about the nature of knowledge work using first principles thinking, most office jobs do not require physical proximity to another person in order to accomplish the task.
- One common object to WFH from office managers will go something along the lines of, "but an electrician can't work from home, so why should you?"
- My response is simple – working on site for the trades isn't an Excess Burden to the job, it's a physical requirement. It's a burden for sure, but since an electrician has to be in the literal job site location to pull wire, it's not an Excess Burden.
- If you're fortunate enough to have a job that **could** be accomplished from anywhere with a computer and an internet connection, then requiring someone to commute to a different chair and sit in front of the same computer is the definition of Excess Burden.

# Leadership Responsibility

- Your responsibility as a leader is to foster an environment for getting work done. That includes attracting the best talent you can for your company. The best talent doesn't tolerate Excess Burdens. Frankly, it's bratty \[need a better word here] for a leader to put Excess Burdens on their employees.
