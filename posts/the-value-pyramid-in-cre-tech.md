I bet that almost every piece of software you've ever used, especially the apps you've paid for, has been run through some sort of mental value model to justify the cost of whatever you've paid for. I know I certainly do it. Even when it comes to free software, there's an evaluation process that we all go through to decide if we want to take the time to integrate it into our daily workflows.

An example for me is something like a web browser. I actually pay for mine, the [Sidekick Pro](https://join.meetsidekick.com/ptos9) browser. I pay up for it because it creates real value for me above and beyond a free browser like Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi, or Edge. It holds all of my primary work apps in a sidebar, creates different browser sessions so I can keep my work separate from my own digital life, and more. *Full disclosure*, the link above is an affiliate link. I just like the browser that much.

But why do I pay for it when I could use Chrome for free? Why does anyone pay for software when there's free or almost free alternatives available? Especially in our industry, where there's been nearly 10K different CRE Tech firms pop up over the last decade or so.

In an attempt to answer this question, I developed my own value theory that I've based my product worldview on for the last couple of years.

# The Value Pyramid

A couple of notes to start this off – this value creation theory is for B2B SaaS businesses, particularly in the CRE Tech industry. If you have a consumer app, or a data provider, this may not be the right strategy for you.

This is what the pyramid looks like:

It's a very simple value creation theory, and should be flexible enough to apply to many different types of applications in our space.

## Why a Pyramid?

To be honest, it's because I'm not clever enough to come up with anything better. BUT, it's easy enough to understand and it works for what we need it to do.

Just like building a literal, physical pyramid, when we're developing our software we have to build it from the ground up. Until our base is built, we can't build our middle layer. Until both the base and middle layers are built, we can't build the top.

This is totally okay, but it will take some restraint not to try and put the capstone on too early. The top of the pyramid is usually our vision for what our tool will ultimately achieve, but it will take use time to get there. Let's talk about what these layers look like.

# Administrate

The first, bottom layer of our pyramid is characterized by:

1. Finding information
2. Enabling faster decision making

Historically, CRE transactions aren't that fast moving. We're not algo trading apartment complexes. However, the amount of information we're using to make investment decisions is increasing. That data requires some serious compute and talent to get right. As your business grows, and as previously inaccessible data because accessible, tooling is going to become more and more important.

The goal of this layer isn't to do any job functions for your user, it's all about accessibility. Does your application allow users to quickly find information that they're looking for? Is there a way for you to get that information to them faster? What's the acceptable rate of precision? Can I get them an answer faster by slightly widening that precision?

Remember, this is the foundation of your platform, but it's just the basics. Whatever part of the deal's lifecycle your platform lives in should deliver that information to your user faster than any other platform, and it should be simpler than any other platform. Do you deliver on that?

# Operate

If the bottom layer of our pyramid was just helping our user FIND STUFF, then this layer is going to help our user DO STUFF. We've successfully built a firm foundation that allows our users to find information and do something without outside of our software. The next step is to let them perform some of those tasks within our platform. Let's find something they're doing in a spreadsheet, and see if we can do it better in our software.

Keep in mind, you're never going to replace Excel. You're never going to achieve a goal of the user never leaving your application. However, I can guarantee there are a couple things that are a royal pain in the a\** to do in Excel that you can automate for your users. That's the goal here.

We start by understanding what our user's workflows look like from end to end. Where can we start bridging gaps inside of our app? What makes sense for us to do here, and what is just going to frustrate our user trying to learn a new way to do something?

Once we've identified those things, we can starting sorting through them to figure out the highest ROI activities for our tech teams and tackle those problems.

# Strategize

I won't lie, I'm disappointed I could come up with a name for this layer that rhymed with Administrate and Operate. This won't make it into a textbook at my Alma Mater if it doesn't all rhyme or start with the same letter...

So you've built up a pretty solid 1st and 2nd value layer in your product pyramid. You presumably got some customers now, and you've got some data to work with. You know the data points your customers find valuable, and you know how they use your tool to make their operation run more smoothly. We've reached a crucial point where we can offer users *forward looking information* to make decisions from – in other words, strategy.

For example, if we're building debt management software, our strategic layer might be optimizing debt structures across our portfolio. Can I use cheap debt in one asset to pay off expensive debt in another asset? What's the optimal debt structure given the business plans for an asset? Will a floating rate loan put you in a negative cashflow state? Will a fixed rate loan make selling or refinancing cost prohibitive at any point? Asset management and pipeline management platforms also their own versions of these questions they need to be able to answer in order to top off their pyramids.

Unfortunately, there's no magical formula to getting this right. I think this is where the breakdown for most products happen, how do I answer a question where there is no verifiable answer? Unlike the first two layers, we're not retrieving and manipulating known values, we're trying to help answer questions that we can't really prove the answer to. That's what strategy is after all, a conviction to operating in a certain market with a certain set of objectives and constraints.

## Successful Strategic Applications

IMHO, the key to being successful in this is to provide users with the ability to answer very specific questions, but in a framework that is flexible enough to let users explore.

Using our example above around debt optimization, while we do want to be able to give our users an "optimal" answer, that can't be the only option you provide. There might be some reason they don't want to or can't make that specific optimization happen, so the user should be able to manipulate variables. If I pull one lever, what happens to the rest?

Conversely, the solution to your user can't be an open-ended "slice and dice your data" solution. *They don't need **your** solution to do that.* Let me repeat that:

> They don't need **your** solution to slice and dice data.

Sure, you can get to the answer
