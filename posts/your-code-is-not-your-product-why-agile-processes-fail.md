- There’s a lot of folks declaring that Agile is dead.
- It’s hardly dead, Agile is a philosophy, not a process (the irony, #4 of the agile manifesto is people over process).
- Some folks see software building as an assembly line process. Write some stories, give them to the engineers, and have them build the thing.
- The problem with this thought process is it abstracts software engineering as manufacturing. The truth is that writing code is R&D.
- We talk about software as building a product, which is true. I think this is where the misalignment of expectations comes about, especially with those who don’t write software.
- If we built a physical product, we would have an assembly line where we built the parts and then slowly assembled all the parts together. This is where most people’s minds go when they think about the process. Surely we’ll just build a login page, and then an authentication mechanism, then some CRUD, etc.
- Where the analogy fails is that with a physical product, the product was engineered and designed LONG before the first copy is rolled off the assembly line. When we’re building a software product, we’re in the R&D phase. There is no assembly line. There is no predicability.
- Remember, the idea of manufacturing is that we build COPIES of something that has already been design. The code we right does the manufacturing. It creates and executes copies of the software for the people that buy and use our products.
- When you’re building software, you’re building the assembly line that‘s going to manufacture your product (the service your software provides), it’s not the software itself.
