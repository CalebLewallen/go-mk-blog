Things we call tech debt were the result of tradeoff decisions we made navigating real world problems.

I'm not talking about shortcuts you took that cause things to break in production – that's a bug, not tech debt.

No, I'm talking about the short-term solutions that we knew wouldn't "scale" (scale to what? Over what measure?). The solutions we put into place because of some edge case that was discovered last minute.

That isn't tech debt. That's a tradeoff decision made in the moment. At some point in the future, if we decide to redesign or refactor that decision, we'll make a new set of tradeoff decisions. Speed for scalability.
