From a startup to Fortune 100, here's some of my personal takes on building products in 2024.

# What to build

Much of your job in product is trying to figure out what to build and how it will bring value to the company or product. Sometimes it's easy to get sucked down into the mire, and lose the forest for the trees.

- Sometimes what to build is already known. The temptation for analysis paralysis is real. Pulling out the latest and greatest framework your favorite Medium or Substack blogger has posted about, sending out surveys, and talking to a hundred users. Sometimes this is the right answer. Other times, we just need to build.
- Whatever you've been asked to build is often not what the person wants. People – your boss, engineering partners, clients, customers, etc – are almost always asking for a specific outcome, not a specific implementation.
- The right answer to "what to build" is often nothing. Maybe the solution isn't software. Maybe it is software, but you're not the person/company/product to solve it.
- Today's hot tech probably isn't the answer. 10 years ago is was big data, 5 years ago it was web3, now it's AI. More likely than not, this isn't the answer to your product problem. Boring tech gets returns, hype does not (they probably wouldn't need that Series D/E funding round if it did).

# How to build

I've built an application from a spreadsheet to a complex, fully functioning application. I've also stepped into a maze of legacy applications. Most of the answers to how to build are the same.

- Build something narrow, end to end. Forget the frills, error handling, edge cases and all that. Just get something work from initial input to final output. You'll learn more doing this than months of planning.
- Simple isn't the same as easy (a la Evan). Simplicity is simply the lack of complexity. Easy is repeating something familiar. Simple software is better than easy software. Easy software is usually complex – you might have built the parts before, but never the whole.
- You don't need to build everything from scratch. Unless it's your core value generation, whatever problem you need to solve has already been solved. There's an open source or commercial product out there that probably solves this for you.

# Working with People

Product roles are as much about connecting with people as they are about solving problems. Don't be a jerk, you're not Steve Jobs (even if you were, don't be a jerk).

- Be an ally with your internal partners. Don't shift blame, don't pretend a failing project is the fault of some other party. You're all on the same team – build your interpersonal skills to learn how to work **with** your team, not against them.
- Hold strong opinions, but hold them loosely. If you're going to form an opinion, be committed to it, otherwise stay neutral. If you form a strong opinion, be ready to change it in the face of new information (unless you're *really* convinced you're right).
- If you're a leader, don't be a jerk for missed deadlines. Most of the time they're arbitrary anyways. If no one died, who cares? If I'm leading a team and we missed a deadline, it's probably my fault anyway.
