I had a couple of great mentors early in my career taught me the difference between systems that are **complex** and those that are **complicated**.

Something with high complexity just means your systems has a lot of intricacies – this might be due to the nature of the industry, the business logic you have to support, or any other number of factors. But like following a highway interchange, there's a kind of elegance to it, patterns that show up again and again that make the system understandable, despite the complexity.

That's in a stark contrast to a system that's just complicated. Remember Calvinball?

This is what a complicated system is like. To get this user role, we call module A, unless that user needs access to subsystem Y, in which case that's a special permissions set in module B, but we have to make a call to an HTTP endpoint to see if the user has permission to see if they have those permissions.

## Complex is OK, Complicated is not

Almost all systems you build
